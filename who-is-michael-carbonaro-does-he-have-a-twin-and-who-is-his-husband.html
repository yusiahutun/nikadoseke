The acclaimed magician, actor, and improv artist is truly a trickster at heart who has built a prosperous career by just being himself, putting his unique skills to the test, and doing what he knows best.</p><p>Besides being a skilled magician and engaging entertainer, Michael Carbonaro is also an excellent liar and loves performing inventive tricks on unsuspecting members of the public who are unaware that he is a magician.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=a-peek-into-michael-carbonaros-early-life-and-family-background></span><strong>A Peek Into Michael Carbonaro’s Early Life And Family Background</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born with the given name of Michael Joseph Carbonaro, the famous thespian has his date of birth recorded as the 28th of April 1976 and was born in Oakdale, New York, where he spent a better part of his growing up years. Michael Carbonaro’s place of birth indicates that he is an American by nationality but white by ethnicity. The actor grew up in a normal family setting with an electrician as a father and a nurse as a mother. Michael, who is not the only child of his parents grew up alongside one older brother Charles Carbonaro.</p><p>He achieved his early academic qualifications at Connetquot High School in Bohemia, New York and while he was still a student, Michael Carbonaro had already started performing magic professionally, earning his college tuition as a teenager in the process. The quest for further education took him to NYU Tisch School of the Arts where he earned a BA in drama.</p><p>Obviously, Carbonaro’s first love has always been magic which he has been performing since childhood. From many years of performing in comedy clubs and school gymnasiums to paying his way through school by performing hundreds of magic shows, the prankster launched himself into stardom.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-carbonaro-effect-and-other-career-milestones></span><strong>The Carbonaro Effect And Other Career Milestones</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The trickster is equally an actor who has had recurring roles on TV shows and movies such as Happily Divorced, The Newsroom, 30 Rock, How to Make it in America, The Wizards of Waverly Place,&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy,&nbsp;CSI Miami, Another Gay Movie, and many more. His starring roles as an actor on both the small and big screens led to regular series of magical appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.</p><p>However, Michael’s mastery of illusion is his true claim to fame. He is best known for his hit comedic series on truTV&nbsp; – The Carbonaro Effect, where he plays tricks on unsuspecting citizens all caught on his own hidden camera. On the TV series which began airing since 2014, the magician has performed over five hundred comically perplexing and mind-blowing feats of magic, spiced with his signature blend of bizarre antics, audience interaction, and hilarious video clips.</p><p>More so, the prankster regularly showcases his comedy, magic, and other bizarre acts at corporate events, various clubs around the US, including Hollywood’s Magic Castle and Joe’s Pub, among others, through his highly-acclaimed national theatre tour, ‘Michael Carbonaro Live!’</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-has-quite-a-few-accolades-to-show-for-his-works-in-entertainment></span><strong>He Has Quite A Few Accolades To Show For His Works In Entertainment</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Carbonaro’s unique brand of magic and elaborate illusions hoodwinking an unsuspecting public quickly made him a viral sensation and earned him quite a following. Numerous young fans, including their parents, constantly reach out to him on social media, and according to Michael, he feels a responsibility to be a good role model. He stated that it makes him happy that the younger generation actually looks up to him as an inspiration, especially those of them who might be struggling with their sexuality. The actor confessed to not having a gay role model while he was a kid.</p><p>The magician’s creative skills have also earned him some accolades. In 2006, he won the Outfest’s Best Actor Award for his role in Another Gay Movie, as well as the Magician of the Year award by the Academy of Magical Arts.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=michael-carbonaro-is-openly-gay></span><strong>Michael Carbonaro Is Openly Gay </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The New York-born trickster is openly gay and serves as a dedicated advocate of the LGBTQ community. According to Michael who claims to be born a homosexual, growing up gay affected the way he saw the world and his role as an artist.</p><p>Though the magician initially had to keep his sexuality a secret in his early years because the society wasn’t as liberal as it is today, he eventually identified with his lifestyle following the advent of gay rights. The trickster who prefers not to disclose much about his personal life in public believes he is not necessarily out or in the closet.&nbsp;For Michael, his TV show and live performances have nothing to do with his sexuality which is why he never professionally came out as gay.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-has-been-in-a-same-sex-marriage-since-2014></span><strong>He Has Been In A Same-Sex Marriage Since 2014</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>With the advent of gay rights, many gay people became bold enough to come out of the closet and proclaim their sexuality to the world, and Michael Carbonaro is not an exception. More than proclaiming his sexual orientation, the veteran artist went into a same-sex relationship with Peter Stickles born on the 8th of October 1976, though, we don’t have the details on when and how they met. Peter is an American and equally a popular actor best recognized for his roles as the voyeuristic Caleb in Shortbus and Damian in the television series, The Liar.</p><p>The duo solemnized their union in a 2014 wedding and from what is obvious, they have been living happily as a married couple ever since. On his own part, Michael Carbonaro seems to be really proud of his husband Peter and has never made any conscious effort to hide their relationship from the world. The proudly gay magician even thanked his husband from the stage when he won the Academy of Magical Arts Magician of the Year Award. He was also quick to respond to a Twitter post where he acknowledged Peter as his husband. The post was shared by a keen-eyed fan after Peter Stickles’ appearance on his interview in January 2018.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-speculations-about-michael-carbonaros-twin-came-up></span><strong>How Speculations About Michael Carbonaro’s Twin Came Up</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As Michael Carbonaro began to gain popularity as a magician, rumours and even arguments began to run rife that he had an identical twin brother. These speculations emanated from the fact that in several of his live magic shows the thespian has been seen in two places at the same time, and since having the powers of bi-location is out of the question, spectators came to the logical conclusion that Michael must have an identical twin to be able to perform such mind-blowing magic tricks.</p><p>However, the ability to leave his audience speculating is only a testament to the prankster’s extraordinary magic tricks. Reports have shown that Michael is not a twin, in fact, he is the younger of two sons born to his parents, and more so, he shares no striking resemblance with his older brother Charles. Besides, it has been confirmed that his tricks can be done without the use of a secret twin, and how he continues to perform these astonishing magic tricks on stage remains a mystery to his audience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ymoJygkZq5bq%2FAq5moppGnvG6wzp6qZqCVYrWiwsRmmGasp567bq3NnWSwoJ9itrR5x6KqZqClqK%2BiusNoY2VkXGF5bQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./11-greek-salad-nutrition-facts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>11 Greek Salad Nutrition Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./melanie-leis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Melanie Leis - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Divorce, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
