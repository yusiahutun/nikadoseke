There’s the thrilling account from one of Ted Bundy’s former coworkers and confidants, or the unique perspective of the Manson trial prosecutor. Or perhaps you’re in the mood for a “non-fiction novel,” a book that reads as if it were fictional, though everything printed on the pages did, in fact, happen IRL.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/best-clothing-sales-right-now-winter.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/anua-cleansing-oil-tiktok.png><p><span>Whether you’re completely obsessed with true crime or want to give this genre a go, I have a hunch you’ll be flipping through these books like there’s no tomorrow—they’re just that good.</span></p><p><span>From </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Truman Capote</span></a><span> to </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Ann Rule</span></a><span>, you’re in for a scary treat with these six true crime books that I can personally vouch for.

She worked at a Seattle crisis clinic with the serial killer that’s known for his glib demeanor in the public eye and savage tendencies in private. Like so many other serial killers, Bundy had two completely different personalities and lived two vastly different lives. Rule recounts how she came to know the facet that charmed her.

So many people have covered Manson, but what makes </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><i><span>Helter Skelter</span></i></a> <span>stand out from the rest of the pack is that it’s written by the prosecuting attorney in the Manson trial, Vincent Bugliosi. He witnessed the cult leader and his followers in a way few did. Bugliosi does an amazing job at setting the scene for the murders and trials, and details what exactly happened on those two fatal days in California. His tone draws you in and keeps you hooked from the first page to the very last.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Each page is riveting, with a fresh revelation. Bugliosi, the prosecutor in the Manson cases, is a highly intelligent terrier in searching out … everything,” explains one Amazon reader. “The brilliance results from the decision to explain the case chronologically, from the point of view of the law, and so each part becomes clearer and more devastating as time moves forward.</span></p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$18.69 (was $29.95)</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/the-devil-in-the-white-city-book-amazon.jpeg><h2><i><span>The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America</span></i><span> by Erik Larson</span></h2><p><span>If you’re both a history and true crime buff, </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><i><span>The Devil in the White City</span></i></a> <span>is right up your alley. It fuses two lives: the architect of the first world’s fair in Chicago, Daniel Hudson Burnham, and murderer slash doctor, Henry. H. Holmes. Larson weaves the two narratives together seamlessly from start to finish. You get all of the historical details of the Gilded Age as experienced in Chicago, along with troubling details of a killer who used this first-of-its-kind fair to rope in his victims. The storytelling is so good that </span><i><span>The Devil in the White City </span></i><span>reads like a work of fiction (a.k.a. a “non-fiction novel”), even though it’s very much non-fiction. Yes, these two people actually walked the streets of Chicago, but each with extremely different motives.</span></p><p><span>“This is one of the best books I have ever read,” wrote one </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>five-star reviewer</span></a><span> on Amazon. “Non-fiction that reads like a novel, full of history, intrigue, and suspense.

All four members of the clan were shot in their home located in Holcomb, Kansas. The murder took place in a rural small town in 1959, so this was a big deal and garnered attention from around the country. What keeps readers glued to Capote’s pages is the fact that there are virtually no clues left behind by the killers. Capote masterfully puts the pieces of the puzzle together—from the murder to the trial to the eventual execution of the two killers. He has a special way of building suspense. Just like Larson’s </span><i><span>The Devil in the White City, </span></i><span>Capote’s piece is a non-fiction novel that you will seriously struggle to close.</span></p><p><span>One </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>reviewer</span></a><span> on Amazon sums up the book to perfection: “From the beginning pages, with his haunting description of Holcomb, Kansas, a place so off the grid it was called ‘out there’, to the machinations of the two now infamous losers, Dick and Perry, and the heartbreaking details of the day before the deaths of the Clutters—described as a solid, superior American family—one is spellbound.” They add, “How could it happen? Why did it happen? Does evil really need a reason or just an excuse? These are questions that resonate as one races through the book, feeling the pain and sorrow of everyone in the close-knit town, a town where no one even bothered to lock their doors.”</span></p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$14.95 (was $16.95)</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/fatal-vision-book-amazon.jpeg><h2><i><span>Fatal Vision: A True Crime Classic</span></i><span> by Joe McGinniss</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><i><span>Fatal </span></i><span>Vision</span></a><span> chronicles the murders of a pregnant wife and her two small children. The person everyone’s looking at as a suspect? Her husband, Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald, who, after the fact, hired the author to write this gripping book on his behalf. MacDonald is an all-American guy who received an Ivy League education and works as a physician, so not who the average person would expect one bit. And though he claims he didn’t commit the brutal murders, there’s a lot more to the story.</span></p><p><span>“Few non-fiction books have been as riveting as this, but Joe McGinniss was a phenomenally focused writer and researcher who had the inside track of the notorious Jeffrey MacDonald case,” wrote one </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Amazon reader</span></a><span>. “Scrupulously written and detailed, the late, famed author presented a frightening portrait of a brilliant, charismatic, but obviously guilty psychopath who still remains, incredibly, deep in a state of denial, stubbornly convinced of his innocence.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/the-journalist-and-the-murderer-book-amazon.jpeg><h2><i><span>The Journalist and the Murderer</span></i><span> by Janet Malcolm</span></h2><p><span>If you speed through </span><i><span>Fatal Vision</span></i><span>, the next logical read is </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><i><span>The Journalist and the Murderer</span></i></a><i><span>, </span></i><span>because what happens when a killer hires an author to write about his case in a favorable light, except the book is anything but that?
