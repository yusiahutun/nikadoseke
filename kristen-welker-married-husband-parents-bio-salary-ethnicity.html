Her romantic life was clouded by a full workflow and the relationships she was able to build ended in a wreck.</p><p>She revealed to NYT that if she thought about her love life, she would ask herself, “What is wrong with me? Her bad experiences made her complain, “That happens to everyone else, but maybe not to me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kristen-Welker-Married.jpg><p>Her grief was turned into joy when a mutual friend joined her with John in October 2014.

And the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Ana Navarro’s Wiki, Bio, CNN, Husband, Weight, Family</a></strong></p><p>Although Kristen is always on TV, John hadn’t seen her until that day. He told NYT that he was getting his news from other sources. However, he was impressed by what he saw and thought that Kristen was “out of his league”.</p><p>Kristen knew that John was “the One,” after her second date, where John gave her a crossword puzzle with presidential quizzes and clues that he had written himself.</p><p>“This is the moment he caught me.

John said;</p><p>“I wanted to ask her out in a place where you could pass years later and tell your kids that we got engaged in that place.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kristen-Welker-Married-1.jpg><p>His exact words were: “I couldn’t imagine not being with you for the rest of my life.
