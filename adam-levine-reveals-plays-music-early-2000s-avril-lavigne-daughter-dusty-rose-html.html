But once we got into the rhythm of it, it was pretty easy, because I just kind of immersed myself in it, and once I kind of got lost in the process of just continuing to write songs. And it was like that's always how it is, man.

And when we actually saw her in person, and we shot the video together, I told her. I was like the little break where you go to the melodic thing, to be honest, it actually shows this new kind of branch of what she does, and this new versatility that she's going to show everybody right now. And I was so, I remember when I heard it, I was like, Oh, that's big. That's a side of her I had never really heard yet.'</p><img id=i-46bbe73b1d053050 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/03/04/07/40029508-9324657-image-m-51_1614843724672.jpg height=781 width=634 alt="New album: Adam, shown with Behati in February 2020 in Beverly Hills, also revealed that Maroon 5's new album is 'done' and teased that its release was 'not far off'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>New album: Adam, shown with Behati in February 2020 in Beverly Hills, also revealed that Maroon 5's new album is 'done' and teased that its release was 'not far off'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZnBsamRrgnh7oJ2YpmV8msOqusRmqZ6ulZa5tHnPpZiyq12iwrS1wmacmqqcrnpzfI9pqmZ5pqe2rXmrmq2in56aeqWt1KCfrZ2iYpG2v9OyZIuno5p7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./271505-best-african-hairstyles-weave-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Best African weave hairstyles to try out</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jurassic-park-actors-where-are-they-now-sam-neill-samuel-l-jackson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where are the stars of Jurassic Park now as Sam Neill reveals heartbreaking news?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
