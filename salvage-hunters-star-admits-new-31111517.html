He explained: "I'm putting the house back to exactly how it was the day it was finished in 1790. I'm using original paint finishes, installing reclaimed radiators and period bathroom features.</p><p>"I'm keeping my Conwy cottage, but this is a big move I'm making. It has cost me all the money I've ever had."</p><p>Now split from his co-presenter and long-term partner Rebecca, Drew has a lot of time on his hands. And he's decided to use it to write a book, titled How Not to Be an Antiques Dealer: Everything I've Learnt, That Nobody Told Me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31096916.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_MAIN-Gone-Fishing-fans-fume-over-new-host-as-Bob-Mortimer-is-replaced-on-BBC-show.jpg><p>In addition, he's opened up on his eventful childhood, which centred around his infatuation with old things, including cast-offs in old cars. As a youngster, he and his pals, would enter stealth mode and sneak up to garden sheds in his home village of Glan Conwy. However, they never intended to steal anything; they merely wanted to take a peek at what was inside.</p><p>He told Quest: “I was just utterly fascinated with it, and it’s never left me. It’s not something I can explain why; I just had to be around this old stuff all the time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>He continued: “My parents are still digging up boxes of old rubbish I found when I was a kid – I’d drag it all home. They even built another shed for me as I’d filled all the sheds in the garden with junk."</p><p>Despite his intrigue with the past, Drew struggled at school, coming away with no qualifications. However, proving there's more than one road to success, he applied his mind and emerged as one of the top international dealers in fine antiques, art and furniture.</p><p>In his remarkable career, he's accumulated an awe-inspiring list of clients. As per North Wales Live, the TV legend works with American fashion designer, Ralph Lauren, and esteemed chef, Marco Pierre White.</p><p><b>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters</b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#> <b><u>here</u></b></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdloqpqkppa0pnnHrqWtnaKoerTAwKtkmpydnsG0ec2ermZrYWZ%2BcoGQcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shane-gillis-snl-monologue-meets-dead-silent-crowd-but-one-joke-pulled-through.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shane Gillis' SNL monologue meets 'dead silent' crowd but one joke pulled through</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./berniece-julien.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Berniece Julien Bio, Wiki, Height, Husband &amp;amp; Divorce</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
