However, in June 2021, the rapper was convicted guilty of assaulting Jones in Streatham, South London.&nbsp;On Friday, April 8, he was sentenced to a community order with a 24-week curfew and a 12-month restraining order at Croydon Magistrates’ Court.&nbsp;Dizzee gave the cameras a thumbs-up before entering the courtroom, wearing a red hat, a casual grey jacket, black trousers, and shoes.</p><h2>Dizzee Rascal’s net worth</h2><p>He is regarded as a pioneer of grime music, and his work incorporates elements of UK garage, bassline, British hip hop, and R&B. He is also known as Dylan Kwabena Mills.&nbsp;The 37-year-net old’s worth is estimated to be approximately $3.5 million by CelebrityNetWorth. Despite the fact that precise information about his assets is unknown, he has made a lot of money through his career in the music business.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Dizzee-Rascal-2.jpg alt="Dizzee Rascal" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In 2003, Dylan released his first album, Boy in da Corner. He won the Mercury Prize in 2003 and has since been regarded as a grime classic. His subsequent albums – Showtime, Maths + English, and Tongue n’ Cheek – were equally well welcomed by the audience.&nbsp;Tongue n’ Cheek sold over 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. He’s also had a string of hit tunes, including Dance with Me, Bonkers, Holiday, Dirtee Disco, Shout, and others.</p><p>Dirtee Stank, his record label, was also founded by him. Mills founded and owns the label, which is co-run by his manager Cage, label manager Laurence Ezra, tour manager Paddy Stewart, and executive producer Teriy Keys.&nbsp;According to Cage, the label seeks to showcase great musicians who have societal issues that could frighten off other companies. It also assists artists in overcoming obstacles like gaining access to studios that transform a raw demo into something that people would get excited about on the street.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Dizzee-Rascal-3.jpg alt="Dizzee Rascal" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>More information about Dizzee Rascal’s trial</h2><p>Dizzee Rascal was found guilty of assaulting Cassandra Jones in March 2022 following a trial in which a judge ruled that he had been harsh and belligerent.&nbsp;Mills shoved Cassandra to the ground and forced his forehead on her throughout the trial, Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court heard.

When the authorities came, Mills informed them he was the aggressor, but subsequently disputed the claims in a police interview while presenting a prepared statement.&nbsp;Dizzee Rascal proceeded to shatter a photographer’s camera outside the court after knocking it out of their hands and flinging it across the road after being found guilty.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiborKqmrJuvsCsmpqkXayutHnCqKWvoZOpsqV5zp9kmqujlsKtwMinnmagmah6psSMn6CappOasm6vwKyqmqaUp65uts6nnKxn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./415158-greg-gutfeld-net-worth-wife-house-weight-loss-happened-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Greg Gutfeld: Net worth, wife, house, weight loss, what happened</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./534768-50-rap-lyrics-birthdays-send-friends-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>50+ rap lyrics about birthdays to send to your friends and family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
