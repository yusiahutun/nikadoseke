Before you try any random product, understanding the type of skin you have and the product that best suits it is an extremely important education you need to have. Any use of the wrong product could cause a bad chemical reaction, thereby damaging your skin. You might not notice it right away, but in the long run your skin barriers will weaken and cause a lot of problems. Serums with ingredients like vitamin C and hyaluronic acid can protect your skin from dullness, dark spots, or even aging signs that can be caused by harsh environments. Since everyone’s skin reacts differently to different products, you need to pick the one that works the best for your skin.</p><p>“When it comes to sensitive skin, it's essential to choose skincare ingredients that are gentle, soothing, and unlikely to cause irritation. While individual sensitivities can vary, some ingredients are generally considered safe and well-tolerated by sensitive skin types”, says Dr. B.R.N. Padmini, a serving consultant in the plastic surgery unit of CARE Hospitals, Hyderabad.</p><p>Laying down the basic difference between sensitive skin serums and other serums, our contributor Dr. Zeeshan Afzal, MD — Welzo, an online healthcare platform says, “Sensitive skin serums are formulated to be extra gentle on the skin and to not irritate delicate skin, typically avoiding ingredients that can cause reactions, unlike other serums which may contain more active or potent ingredients.”</p><p>According to a board-certified dermatologist, Andrea Suarez, MD, FAAD, “Sensitive skin refers to unpleasant sensory experiences when your skin comes in contact with things that are otherwise innocuous”. In some cases, lack of skin care products can even lead to cancer if you expose yourself too much to harsh UV lights. That is why dermatologists always recommend using skin care products.</p><p>Considering the wide range of products in the market, you can’t blame yourself if you were deceived by claims on a product’s packaging or in an advertisement. It’s just impossible to find the right one on your own, so our team of experts have curated 15 best serums for sensitive skins from across the internet so that you don’t have to break a sweat.</p><p>Our top picks</p><p><h2 class=title>16 Best Serums for Sensitive Skin</h2></p><p>Reap the benefits of antioxidants with this plant-based serum from TruSkin to boost your skin radiance.

If you have oily, dull, acne-prone, or dry skin, you need to choose serums with the right type of ingredients so that they don’t cause any unexpected reactions. If you have oily skin, you will need to choose a product that provides hydration and has non-comedogenic properties.

For example, if you have started seeing aging signs, maybe something like Eclat Natural Skincare Vitamin C Serum will work the best. And, if you are proactively trying to prevent any type of skin issue, you can choose something like the all-in-one Vibriance Super C Penetrating Serum.</p><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Vitamin C is a common ingredient on most of these products, but there are other ingredients that you need to look out for.
