Likewise, some stars like their fans and followers wondering about their sexual orientation. So does Shawntae Harris, aka Da Brat.</p><p style=text-align:justify>American rapper Da Brat has never opened up about her sexual orientation but has been found dating both males and females. Is&nbsp;she straight by sexuality? Lesbian? What about her partner? Let’s find it out.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Behind Da Brat's Sexual Orientation: Gay Or Lesbian?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>According to afterellen.com, in an interview in the year 2011, De Brat revealed that she likes to keep her sexuality private. She said:- <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>“I hope they stay fascinated with my sexuality because that’s something that makes them wonder.&nbsp;Some people feel like they know; some people feel like they wonder; and some people feel like they don’t know. So I probably will NEVER answer that question to make people keep on wondering.”</p><p style=text-align:justify><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/Da%20Brat%20tomboy.jpg ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Da Brat dresses up like a guy who has created many speculations regarding her sexuality (</strong>Source: theboombox.com)</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>She also got questioned about her attire. The way she dresses up has created many thoughts regarding her sexuality. They asked her the reason behind dressing up like a guy. Da Brat answered them as:-</p><p style=text-align:justify>“When I dress tomboyish, I don’t really consider it dressing like a guy. I am a full fledge woman and I like to dress however I feel comfortable. So when I feel like getting glam-med up, and throwing on the Christian Louboutins, and the weave, or whatever I’m going to do to my hair, and push up my t******&nbsp;in a push-up bra, throw on my La Perla, then that’s what it is and I’m comfortable either way. But when I’m performing or just, on the day to day, or in the streets, I’ll probably have my braids with my hat cocked to the back.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Like it or not, Da Brat has a point. Because someone wears clothes a certain way doesn't mean it defines his/her sexual orientation.&nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Da Brat Photographed Partying With Alleged Girlfriend&nbsp;</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Though Da Brat hasn’t uttered a single word regarding her sexuality, many people have hypothesized her as gay due to her actions and attire.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Similar</strong>:-&nbsp;<a href=# title="Queen Latifah Former Girlfriend Pregnant; Has Anything To Do With It?" rel=follow>Queen Latifah Former Girlfriend Pregnant; Has Anything To Do With It?</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>In September 2015, she was seen partying with her new girlfriend in Tao, a nightclub in Las Vegas. Celebrities like Black Chyna, Wilmer Valderrama, Amber Rose, Nick Cannon, and James Harden were also present in the club. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>According to sandrarose.com, gay rapper Da Brat was sitting in the VIP corner with her girlfriend. Loyal reader&nbsp;Hilary, perhaps a reporter to Sandra Rose, wrote:-</p><p style=text-align:justify>“So Dat Brat was out & about in Vegas with her undercover lover. Brat was rockin great make up, we all had a great time & Brat made sure that she was in the VIP’s VERY back corner so she and her girl could get reallllllly intimate. The joke of the night was “y’all get a room!” because of their…. How should I say… Goings on.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>To this day, the identity of Da Brat's alleged girlfriend isn't known to the public. All things point towards the affair being short-lived.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Swinging Both Ways; Da Brat's List Of Boyfriends & Girlfriends</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Before making girlfriends, Da Brat used to have boyfriends. She was not only linked up but also rumored to be dating many male celebrities from the town. In Jan 2006, Da Brat was found dating American television personality David Gest.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Ten years after getting linked with the legendary rapper, in April 2016, David - who gained popularity for being the husband of Liza Minnelli - passed away at Four Seasons hotel in London, United Kingdom. Reports suggested that he was abusing sleeping pills and consuming body enhancement drugs to treat his pneumonia, which could have contributed to the death. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Rapper In Our Vault</strong>:-&nbsp;<a href=# title="Who Is FatBoy SSE?

She was raised in two different households with her siblings as her parents were never married. Actress LisaRaye McCoy is her younger half-sister.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Her parents' not getting married was by no means the worst tragedy the McCoy siblings faced; learning about her father's brutal murder in 1988 was the worst thing that ever happened to them.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-605 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Da Brat's father, David Ray McCoy, a&nbsp;renowned businessman in Chicago,&nbsp;was murdered by his then-girlfriend Sheila Daniels with her brother's assistance over a financial rift. Sheila and her brother, Tyrone, are currently serving their 80 years and 60-year sentence.</p><p style=text-align:justify>During her sophomore and junior year, she attended Kenwood Academy.

Her debut album Funkdafied (1994) was an immense success. She has also participated in the fifth season of the VH1 reality series Celebrity Fit Club in 2006. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-625 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Since July 2015, she has been working as a co-host for the Rickey Smiley Morning Show. Brat’s net worth is estimated to be $3 million.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Despite her impressive net worth & regular stream of income from her music, she currently finds herself in a difficult financial time. Fearing the possibility of seeing a jail sentence, the 44-year-old rapper filed for bankruptcy in August of 2018 after losing a $6 million lawsuit against her assault victim Shyla Stevens. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-626 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>At the filing of her bankruptcy, she cited her debt to be around $7 million. Unlike Brat, her sister seems to be flourishing both on personal as well as career fronts.
