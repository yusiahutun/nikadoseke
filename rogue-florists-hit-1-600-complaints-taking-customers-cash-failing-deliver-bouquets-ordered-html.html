Go to BBB.org for BBB Business Profiles on more than 20,000 florists. Read what previous customers say, and see how the business responds to complaints. This information may help narrow down the list of online and local florists.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Know when to place your order. </span>During the holidays, orders for floral arrangement increase dramatically, and prices often go up. Order early to ensure your order arrives on time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Be a savvy shopper.</span> When shopping online, take your time and read the fine print before submitting your order. Look for the return policy and be sure you understand the delivery process. Look for added fees like shipping, handling, and delivery. Review your order and verify the total before confirming your purchase. Find out how the business handles customer complaints and what recourse you will have if the floral arrangement is unsatisfactory.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Pay with a credit card</span>. Credit cards provide additional protections, and it's easier to dispute charges. Debit, prepaid, or gift cards don't have the same protections as credit cards.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Know the delivery method.</span> Some online florists have different delivery methods: same-day, international, standard, and guaranteed. Be sure you know which delivery service you are paying for and that you have allowed enough time. Some florists may offer a discount if you send your flowers to arrive a few days early since that helps them with the rush on holiday.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Make sure the business has your contact information. </span>When it comes to flower delivery, there are times when a driver will need additional information or directions. Ensure the florist or retailer has a callback phone number to help them reach you and ensure your loved one gets what you expect.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Read the description.</span> Online photos use a perfect setting and professional lighting to make the products look as attractive. Your final product may not look quite the same. Make sure you know what you're getting.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Don't be deceived by promotions.</span> You may encounter online promotions during especially popular times like Mother's Day or Valentine's Day. Most have terms and conditions, so check that you're getting the savings you expect.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Track your purchases. </span>When using a third party to deliver flowers, it's hard to tell when and if they were delivered. Sign up for confirmation emails to prove the order was placed and an alert when the order is delivered.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Take a photo.</span> Ask the recipient to send you a photo of the delivered arrangement so that you can compare it to the online photo or what was promised in the shop. If the product differs considerably, you may want to ask for an adjustment in the price.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic>Source: BBB.org&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Bc4CYbGxra1%2BHvKjBxGadpaeinsC1v4yhoK1lYWKDcXyMnKamqJyWtq%2FA0marmqOZo7Rur9Ssq6illafAbq%2FArJ9mnpGeuaq6xmabnqSZq7KzecGorKqtlanAbrvRnZyrnZRjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-sea-salt-spray.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Sea Salt Sprays for Beachy Waves</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./20061026833620.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Princess Mary is expecting her second child</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
