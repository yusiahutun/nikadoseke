Amelia Meath, formerly of the folk trio Mountain Man, met Nick Sanborn in 2012 when he was opening for Amelia's group in Milwaukee. "It was his second show as Made of Oak, his solo project. I knew that we were friends immediately because of the way he danced when he was playing," Meath says. "Another way of saying that is that we both dance like dorks."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On paper the match isn't obvious, but Sylvan Esso's self-titled debut album begs to differ, bringing an air of intimacy and purity to a genre that can easily be muddled with synths and auto-tune.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the midst of the band's international tour, we caught up with Meath to talk about the making of Sylvan Esso.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Was the transition from Mountain Man's organic style to the upbeat pop of Sylvan Esso challenging?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not really. I think that it's super easy to think, "Oh, she's a folk musician who is making pop music." But, really it's just a frame because the content of my folk songs and my pop songs is actually quite similar. It's just that there are different guardrails for writing pop songs than there are for writing folk songs.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How do you tackle writing a song?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The songwriting process is really me singing into the air, writing lyrics and melody. Or Nick makes a beat, and then I sing along to that or change it around however I wish. A lot of it is me being like, "No, no, no, I think this note should be this, 'Laaaa.'" And Nick is like, "OK, sing that note," and we find it on the piano.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Who would you love to have guest on a Sylvan Esso track?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I would just love to sing with Bonnie Raitt. I'd love to do something with Four Tet. That would be super exciting. I really, really want to sing a hook on a hop-hop song – super bad. I want to sing a hook on a Nicki Minaj song, though she doesn't need any help, but I really want to do that. I love Nicki Minaj. Also, doing something with Miley would be really cool. Miley Cyrus is my major #1 crush right now. Like, check her Instagram everyday, #1 type of crush. Her crafting is just ruling my world. It's so cute. Oh, and Yolandi Visser from Die Antwoord. It's a performance art project that is like South African hip-hop. She is amazing.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What differentiates Sylvan Esso from others in the music scene?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It brings our voices to the scene. We wanted to make pop music that has things going on under the initial layer that you hear. There's a beat-y underbelly going on under it. It's not necessarily tortured or anything, but there are many different layers of a story that are being communicated with our songs.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Describe that underbelly.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yeah, sure. Like Coffee for example, a lot of people think it's a really pleasant and lovely song. But, actually, the song is pretty sad, and it's about being lonely and jumping from relationship to relationship and constantly trying to make yourself better and work harder to create the ideal of this imaginary, beautiful, perfect relationship that you've read somewhere about in a book or seen on a movie. And, not being able to do that, and realizing that the failure itself is a part of the process and working through that. And it's also filled with dancing references. You're doing the same dance with everyone over and over again.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Your lyrics feel very universal. Is that intentional?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yes, yes it is intentional. It's really exciting to write songs that are questions, instead of songs that are statements. I love story songs, but at the same time, it's so much more fun to set a scene and paint a picture, than it is to have a thesis statement in a song. I'm much more excited about exploring all of the different folds of a situation.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Reflecting on your album, is there anything that you wish you could tweak?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not really. I mean, there's a certain point where you just have to let it go, and there's a certain point when the album becomes a picture of six months ago and it's no longer your current reality.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGiZoql6o7vOpKpmpaWotqR7yKernqqmnrK4v46aanBqZmTAurjVmqVmnaOovG61za2cq66ZmsRw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./conspiracy-theorists-claim-kylie-minogue-satanic-cult-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Conspiracy theorists claim Kylie Minogue is part of a Satanic cult</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./71-year-old-traditional-barber-shop-soon-close-cornerstone-inaugural-festival-focusing-hong-kongs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>61-year-old traditional barber shop soon to close is the cornerstone of inaugural festival focusing</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
