I just kind of felt like, you know what, 'You're embarrassing me,'" Amara explained.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8c/16by9/2023/11/09/8c49927b78da43e0b47790421b41320a_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>She continued, "You're out here acting all single and talking to other women and doing all types of things make me look... Verme como una estúpida. So I'm like, 'Oh, You know what? Never mind. I had nothing to do with him. And if you want to act single, pues, so am I."</p><p>A lot of the drama, Amara said, came from Safaree's previous relationship with Erica Mena, with whom Safaree shares two children. Though the pair are divorced, Amara said she was often dragged into their drama online.</p><p>"There were a lot of other things happening in his past -- personal &nbsp;life, with things that occurred," She added, alluding to his contentious relationship with Mena. "Someway, somehow, people were trying to drag me into a situation that had nothing to do with me either, so I guess it was just me trying to protect myself from all the negativity that was happening in that moment."</p><p>As for what fans can expect from the second half of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Love and Hip-Hop: Miami</strong></a>, Amara said lots more drama, and a closer look at what really went down between her and Safaree.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c0d6f09f-de43-5f5e-92f1-07deb2e2e53c data-container-ref=toofab:article:94b5343a-59c9-438a-a793-0026c66acd3b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/71/5by4/2019/10/22/71883a58d6c65a59a60711841eff3cfa_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Why Nicki Minaj Fans Are Outraged She Got Married</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Viewers will also see Amara have a sit down with the father of her twin daughters, Sualtesa and Sumajestad, 1, whom she welcomed in March 2022, and the drama that has unfolded with him since their birth -- part of which motivated her to deny her relationship with Safaree.</p><p>"A lot of people did get to see at one point, that I had conflicts with the father of my children. I've been very respectful on the way that I treat that matter," Amara explained. "Even though at one point, I actually feel very terrible that I didn't know how to control my anger -- my anger, my disappointment, my hurt as a woman, as a mother. And I went on Live and exposed and said a lot of things that I probably shouldn't have."</p><p>She continued, "And then this season, you'll see me have that confrontation, that one-on-one conversation with him. Which is also part of the reason why I denied my relationship with Safaree."</p><p>There's a lot people don't know, Amara said, and a lot she's kept private because of her girls, telling TooFab she's working as hard as she possibly can for them.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:43125f0e-1880-4915-99fd-e9eab1eb04ed data-container-ref=toofab:article:94b5343a-59c9-438a-a793-0026c66acd3b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d8/5by4/2023/10/10/d89fa590355f4e27a3839fc8d631821e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">E!</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">New York Made Jax Taylor Cry on House of Villains, Cast Details 'Unprovoked' Attacks (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I work so much, but my girls made me even more ambitious. They made me even more like, 'Let's go get it.' 'Cause I know that they depend on me," Amara, who has been using Latin dating app, Chispa, &nbsp;in hopes of one day finding that Mr. Right, said. "Me siento bendecida. I honestly feel so blessed. That's also another reason why I feel like I also wanted to come into Chispa."</p><p>"I don't know if the fairytale exists, but I would love to find someone that can really love me, that can love my girls. And that's something else that happens, like me, there's a lot of other women on Chispa that now, we're mothers," she continued. "You can't just date anyone. You can't just bring anybody home. You really have to get to know them. Especially, I have two little girls."</p><p>Amara added, "Maybe, eventually, God will bless me with a good man that my girls can see as a father figure. Y todas esas cosas. But my girls have really motivated me to become the best version of me, honestly."</p><p>Her one dating must-have? Treat her like a lady. Amara tells TooFab, when it comes to a first date, she doesn't want to have to split the bill.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/eb/16by9/2023/11/09/ebab0698ecfe475c8332948bd4cf4333_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>"I feel like if we're going on a date, I want to feel like I'm being treated out for dinner. I want to feel like a lady. Give me the whole experience. That's just me. I'm more traditional in that aspect," Amara explained. "Some people feel that if it's a first date, we're still getting to know each other, we're still like on friendzone, and it's OK to split the bill... NO."</p><p>She added, "Even the smallest thing like that, those are important things to talk about before you actually go out on a date. Where's your mindset? How do you visualize things? That whole, 'What do you bring to the table' conversation, maybe that's something that needs to be had before going out on a date."</p><p>The first half of season 5 of Love and Hip-Hop: Miami is currently available to stream on VH1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmamhflrqivsBmo5plnpq0s62MrKuappSoerStxZqpnp1dqK6uwcSlqmadqKW5sL%2FIr5xmpJ%2Brsm6tzZ1koaGgYrWwvIyfoKCgpGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./90-day-fiance-paul-and-karines-sons-taken-by-cps-after-altercation-was-blown-out-of-proportion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>90 Day Fiance Paul and Karines sons taken by CPS after altercation was blown out of propor</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-sea-salt-spray.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Sea Salt Sprays for Beachy Waves</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
