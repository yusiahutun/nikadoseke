Isbell was being critical of <a href=#>Jason Aldean</a>'s "Try That in&nbsp;a Small Town" and challenged&nbsp;Aldean to write a song about his life.</p><p>Owen —&nbsp;whose songwriting career is fascinating, to say the least — fired back. "The 'write your own songs' dagger cuts me deep because I think that is the wrong way to encourage artists trying to make it," he'd share during a lengthy <a href=#>thread</a>.</p><p>In 2023, it's difficult&nbsp;to find modern artists who don't also write, but that doesn't mean the argument has been decided. The economics of being a new country artist almost demand you write your own songs, too. If you want to eat in Nashville, you either need to be a world class entertainer or you need to be able to build a world class chorus.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>11 Country Stars Who Don't Write Their Own Songs + 1 You'll Be Shocked to Learn Does</h2><p>If you think a country singer needs to write their own songs to be a legitimate artist, take this short quiz:</p><p>Just two of those names make this list of 11 country stars who don't write their own songs, and one you'll be surprised to learn does. It's a list that includes four Country Music Hall of Fame inductees and at least two others sure to get in soon. The takeaway is that great singers are great storytellers, especially when they're telling someone else's story.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>64 Artists Not in the Country Music Hall of Fame</h2><p>Which county singer is most deserving of a Country Music Hall of Fame induction?
