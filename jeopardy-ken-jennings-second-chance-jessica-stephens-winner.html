Good job! I was rooting for her, congrats!!"</p><p>Another wrote: "Yay I was hoping Jessica would make it."</p><p>A third wrote: "Wow. What an ending. Good on James for going all in on his Daily Double, it was the right move even if he flubbed the answer."</p><p>Earlier in the match, James landed on a Daily Double - where players can choose how much to wager.</p><p>It read: "Last name of Milton, who moved to Philadelphia in 1876 to start a candy company; that one ended in bankruptcy but another did not."</p><p>James had bet all he had ($6800) and it couldn't have felt sweet when he missed "What is: Hershey."</p><p>Insult to injury, the category poked fun at the premise of the special showdown and was called "So You Blew It The First Time."</p><h2>JESSICA'S SECOND CHANCE</h2><p>Starting on Monday, 18 former losers, for lack of a better word, scored something quite rare - they were invited back after losing their first games last year.</p><p>It's quite an amazing opportunity because when a player loses their first game, they never get another shot at the game show and have to just live with it, until now.</p><p>After losing, the countries' smartest citizens in general knowledge go home with either $1K or $2K and assumably overthink their episode for years to come - but not Jessica.</p><p>Last night, Jessica <a href=#>swept a category </a>of phobias that included "fear of German people" and "fear of nudity" - wearing terrific fish earrings no less.</p><h2>FOOL THEM ONCE</h2><p>On Monday, the slate will be wiped clean and nine more snubbed contestants from the past year will return for three semifinal games and a two-day finale.</p><p>The victor of that weekâ€™s tournament bracket will also score the one remaining slot in the&nbsp;<a href=#>Tournament of Champions</a>&nbsp;which airs directly afterward.</p><p>There, they can beat super-champs like&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy Schenider</a>, Matt Amodio,&nbsp;<a href=#>Mattea Roach</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Ryan Long</a>&nbsp;- or the legends they lost to - in the following two-week prestigious playoffs, which are worth $250K.</p><p>Jessica's original game aired in 2021 and she put up a tough fight against Matt Amodio and Jonathan Fischer - theoretically, they could now face off again in the ToC.</p><p>When both conclude, regular episodes and&nbsp;<a href=#>reigning ace Cris Pannullo</a>&nbsp;will return in a month.</p><p>Other contestants fans will see soon include fan-favorite&nbsp;<a href=#>Sadie Goldberger</a>&nbsp;- whose shock loss to&nbsp;<a href=#>Megan Wachpress&nbsp;</a>on June 20th came down to a controversial ruling from the judges.</p><p>Hundreds felt Sadie was "robbed" as she would have won had the show ruled in her favor during Final Jeopardy.</p><p>The show has stood by that her otherwise correct Final Jeopardy response of "Harriet Tubman" was "incomplete" with but an "n" missing - hundreds were left&nbsp;<a href=#>upset calling it the season's "most painful loss".</a></p><p>Both tournaments will be hosted by Ken and will air at the usual time of 7 p.m. on ABC.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Ken will step aside from the iconic game show in January so that co-host&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>&nbsp;- now handling&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;- can take the reins.</p><p>Over the summer, he and actress&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim</a>&nbsp;were officially announced as the permanent replacements for the&nbsp;<a href=#>late, great Alex Trebek.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-21-at-5.48.32-PM.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-21-at-6.39.20-PM.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-21-at-4.53.20-PM.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZWV9doGYaKGep6CWv6XFjKScp2Wamruvtc2gqmarlZi8r7CMnJ%2BappOaequx0qygnJldqMGmvMeepaxlp567r7HRaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sharon-osbournes-latest-facelift-was-the-worst-thing-she-ever-did.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sharon Osbourne's latest facelift was the 'worst thing she ever did'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cracker-barrel-shares-pride-post-angering-customers-say-family-friendly-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Cracker Barrel shares Pride post angering customers who say it was once 'family friendly'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
