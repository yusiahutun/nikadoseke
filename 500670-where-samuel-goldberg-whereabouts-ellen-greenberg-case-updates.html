Goldberg graduated from Temple University and worked in Stamford, Conn., as a producer for NBC Sports. He keeps his life private, so there isn't much information about his <a href=#>family</a>, net worth, etc.</p><h2>The story of Ellen Greenberg and her controversial death</h2><p class=align-left>Ellen was from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and worked as a school teacher at Juniata park academy. She was living, with her fiancé, Goldberg, in a two-bedroom <a href=#>house</a> in Manayunk.</p><p class=align-left>On January 26, 2011, her fiancé, Sam, found her dead in their Philadelphia apartment. She had been stabbed 20 times, 10 times in her chest, abdomen, and stomach, and 10 times in the back of her head and neck. The knife used was still plunged into her heart.</p><p class=align-left>After investigations, the police claimed that the door to Ellen's apartment was locked from the inside and that there was no sign of struggle.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c58894a859df8de0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Victor Oquendo's wife and what is his sexuality?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Marlon Osbourne, the medical examiner, ruled the death as a homic*de but later changed it to suic*de and closed the case. But a decade later, Greenberg's parents are adamant that their lovely daughter didn't commit suic*de and are pushing for Ellie's justice.</p><h3>What’s controversial about Ellen’s death?</h3><p class=align-left>The fact that Ellen's death was initially ruled as homic*de and then changed to suic*de makes it controversial. Years after Ellen's death, new evidence has emerged.</p><p class=align-left>There are claims that there was no bleeding from her 20 stab wounds. This means that Ellen was already dead when being stabbed. Another claim is that one of Ellen's stab wounds was in her heart, yet she was left-handed.</p><p class=align-left>Lastly, there's a feeling that the 911 call by Ellie Greenberg's fiancé was rehearsed and is being investigated. From the call's audio recording, Ellie Greenberg's fiancé told the 911 operator that Ellie slipped and hit her head.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bf8f6f0a276d3d86.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Grieving Son Faces Jail Time After Mother’s Corpse Found on His Couch Mummified 13 Years Later</span></p></a><h2>Where is Samuel Goldberg now?</h2><p class=align-left>Samuel Goldberg is currently married and has two kids. He and his family, i.e., his wife and kids, live in New York. It's believed that Samuel Goldberg had no involvement in Ellen Greenberg's case, and that's why he was never arrested or charged.</p><p class=align-left>Sam was in the apartment <a href=#>gym</a> and not the house during the incident.
