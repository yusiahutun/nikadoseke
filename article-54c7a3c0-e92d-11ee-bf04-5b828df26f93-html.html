He grew up in a Christian home that was full of laughter, pranks and singing. He was the middle child of three children. His love for the outdoors was contagious. He especially enjoyed hunting, shooting and bass fishing (a passion of which he shared with his nephews and grandson).&nbsp;</p><p>Born in 1943, Jimmy grew up in Laurel and enjoyed playing football with his cousin and best friend Jimmy Dale Pitts. They both played the position of halfback for Laurel High School and won a state championship. In high school, Jimmy also played basketball and ran track. He went on to earn his college degree, a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (with a concentration in accounting) at the University of Southern Mississippi.&nbsp;</p><p>He built a lucrative career in the logistics/transportation industry, working as a terminal manager for Roadway and a driver manager for Howard Transportation. However, he was most appreciative of his relationships with his family and friends. He was Christian and a member of Magnolia Baptist Church. Whether he was telling stories of days gone by, making you laugh, cooking out grilling chicken, cutting a rug or singing karaoke with his beautiful baritone voice, Jimmy was enjoying the time he was given.&nbsp;</p><p>He lived out in the country. On his acres of land, there was always work to be done. After the work was done, he enjoyed fishing while relaxing under that old, majestic oak tree.&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy was preceded in death by his mother Ruby Dean Blackledge Hill; his father Willie Isaac Hill; and his sister Willa Jean Sims.&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy is survived by his loving sister Jane Huddleston (Gayle) of Brandon; his daughter Shannon Robson (Jay) of Mobile; his grandson Cody Hill Robson; his best friend and confidant Leigh Pitts Byrd, whom he also considered a daughter; niece Laurie Huddleston Smith; and nephews Adam and Jonathan Huddleston.&nbsp;</p><p>Services will be at Memory Chapel Funeral Home on Saturday, March 30. Friends and family will be received beginning at 2 p.m. and the memorial service will follow at 2:30 p.m.</p><p>To sign the online guest book, visit <a href=#><span>www.memorychapellaurel.com</span></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKeSnsG2rdGinKxnmp66rsWMnJilrpmjeqm1y6VmmqqknrCtsb5ua5xvkWiwcXnEcmmdZWFmsqZ5wZ9nbWVll4VzhMOfaW%2BeaWh7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sell-ps4-where-why-how-much.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Looking to Sell Your PS4?
