But then the coronavirus hit, their plans were canceled and they were forced to quarantine ... with superstar&nbsp;<a href=#>Luke Bryan.</a></p><p>“Luke Bryan is our really good family friend, so we call him Uncle Luke,” laughs CB30's Christian Clementi during a recent interview with Taste of Country.</p><p>“Before all of this happened, (Luke’s) son Bo was going to have his birthday party in Montana so we could all ski. We had all of our stuff packed, but the day we were supposed to leave, all the ski lifts were closed down," he further explains. "So we came out here to Destin (Florida). Luke has a house down here so we are quarantined down here with Luke's family and our family."</p><p>While it can be tough for any teen to be stuck inside, this brotherly duo is making the best out of it. In fact, with most of their fanbase home and on their cell phones constantly, CB30's popularity on the social networking service TikTok has been skyrocketing. A&nbsp;recent video of&nbsp;the duo&nbsp;doing the<a href=#> Charlie Puth challenge</a> has&nbsp;garnered more than 15 million views in less than a week.</p><p>"I was just in my house and Christian was at a write about a month ago and I was just thinking of some ideas of how we could do the Charlie Puth challenge but make it different than a normal one," says CB30’s Brody Clementi.</p><p>"Since Brody wrote it, I thought he should sing it, but he doesn’t have his license yet so obviously he can’t drive yet," laughs Christian of his brother, who is just 15 years old. "I told him to just park the car and hop in the front seat, but he was like, ‘No, you do it so I don’t get in trouble.'"</p><p>Since that video went viral, the brotherly duo —&nbsp;who were first discovered by Luke Bryan and then signed by his manager, Kerri Edwards —&nbsp;have released a bunch of new TikToks, even ones including <a href=#>Bryan's kids</a>. But while it may look like all fun and games over in the Bryan house right now, they are&nbsp;using the time to get some work done.</p><p>"We are definitely trying to make it a productive time," Christian says. "It's&nbsp;so natural with him. We will finish dinner and pull out a guitar. It's cool that we are with him. Plus, our dad (Jay Clementi) is a songwriter, too, so we have learned so much with him. It's very cool to have two such strong songwriting influences in our lives."</p><p>And for all of the teenagers like&nbsp;these fellas who find themselves stuck at home right now, Christian and Brody have a message:</p><p>"We’ve never seen this in our lifetime," Christian says."It’s a one-time thing. If we are going to get through it together, we need to stay in the house and spend time with the people you love the most so it will go away quicker."</p><p><strong>If You Like a Little Rock In Your Country You'll Love Our Newest RISER:</strong></p><p><strong>43 Reasons You've Gotta Love Luke Bryan:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnJpjZXq3tdGao2asmaDBsLeMr6CdnZ9iuba3xGaZq7GRo3w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./filip-chajzer-and-julia-chajzer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Filip Chajzer and Julia Chajzer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./50-facts-about-bhilai-nagar.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>50 Facts about Bhilai Nagar</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
