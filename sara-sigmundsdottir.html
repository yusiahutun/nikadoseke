She was born to <strong>Hafrun Jonsdottir</strong> (mother) and <strong>Sammy</strong> (father).</p><p>Actually, Sammy is the nickname her father uses. Unfortunately, she has not revealed any accurate information about her father as of the present.</p><p>We can trace her motivation for taking up CrossFit back to her youth and childhood days. She used to like sports a lot when she was young.</p><p>As per an interview in Fitness Volt, Sara used to be a competitive athlete until she discovered CrossFit. Like many CrossFitters, she spent her childhood and teenage years participating in gymnastics.</p><p>She, on the other hand, didn’t have a single passion. Instead, gymnastics, swimming, and dance were her favorite pastimes and interests throughout her growth.</p><p>When she started weightlifting with her family, she realized being good at it. But, most importantly, she enjoyed the thrill and the challenge of it.</p><p>But, CrossFit was a relatively obscure sport to pick up as a career. She needed a push, and it seemed destiny helped give her just that.</p><p>You might like to know about: <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Zhou Lulu Bio: Weightlifting, Olympics & Family</a>.</strong></p><h2>Sara Sigmundsdottir | Professional Career</h2><h3>The Push</h3><p>Sara Sigmundsdottir had it all to transition into the professional CrossFit scene. Her family background supported her to take it up too.</p><p>But, she decided to wait till acquiring her high school degree. Instead, she planned to devote her attention to weightlifting full-time after graduating from high school.</p><p>Similarly, she started saving money by working at the front desk of her local gym. However, being a CrossFit athlete required major expenses like diet and nutrition supplements.</p><p>Eventually, she met Hallgrimur Ingvarsson, a CrossFit affiliate owner. He assisted her in training and introduced her to her coach, Jami Tikkanen.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, Sara adopted the Keto diet and began CrossFit training with Tikkanen. He was her first coach and helped her in almost all the dimensions and transitions.</p><p>She was already taking part in local tournaments at the start of the 2010 decade. And, she was performing bars above average in comparison to others.</p><p>Furthermore, a slew of regional CrossFit competitions was on the horizon. With Sara’s newfound passion for the game, she began to consider pursuing a career in CrossFit.</p><h3>Setting Foot</h3><p>Sara Sigmundsdottir found the move to CrossFit difficult. Nonetheless, she was determined to succeed as she trained at home while working at the gym.</p><p>Similarly, she was following the instructions on the CrossFit website. Coach Jami began preparing Sara for the significant games by increasing her training. &nbsp;Likewise, he was rectifying her shortcomings in training and eating habits.</p><p>As a result, she started competing in local competitions in 2013 and 2014. In 2013, she participated in the Europe Regionals, securing 39th in the individual women category.</p><p>However, she ranked 21st in the region and a mere 427th worldwide. Nonetheless, these results didn’t disappoint her at all. Instead, she was more focused than ever going into 2014.</p><p>Consequently, she ranked in the top fifteen for the Europe regionals securing 12th position. Likewise, she climbed to 75the position worldwide and 6th in her region.</p><p>In one year, she made it to the top ten regionally and topped a hundred worldwide. Sara had all reasons to be inspired and prepared for 2015.</p><h3>Engaging Career</h3><p>With more than two transition years since its debut, Sara felt confident going into 2015. She started the year by competing in the World Weightlifting Championships first.</p><p>In this event, she ranked 29th, but the event helped her set the tone for the rest of the year. Her first success came in the form of a podium finish in the Meridian Regional.</p><p>She had ranked first in the Individual women category. This result meant she was invited to the CrossFit games in 2015. Sara looked to take her winning form into the elite event.</p><p>Consequently, her first attempt in the CrossFit Games resulted in a third-place finish. Likewise, she placed third in the CrossFit Open worldwide and second in the CrossFit open regionals. As a result, the CrossFit community was enthralled by the Icelander.</p><p>2016 was no different by any means. It was an almost identical reflection of what Sara achieved in 2015. She ranked first in the Meridian Regional to make it to the CrossFit games.</p><p>Then, she secured a podium finish in the CrossFit games 2016, securing the third position. Further, she ranked second in the Regionals Open and fourth in the Worldwide Open.</p><p>Additionally, 2016 would be the first time she ranked as the number one CrossFitters in Iceland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sara-sigmundsdottir-2-1024x742.jpg><p>Sara Sigmundsdottir was being known for her consistent performance. She had ranked top three in the CrossFit games consecutively.</p><p>Eventually, she moved to the United States for the 2017 season. Despite this, she repeated the same feat as she went on to win the 2017 Central regionals.</p><p>Unfortunately, she couldn’t get her hands on the ultimate prize as she ranked fourth in the CrossFit games in 2017. But her consistent performances paid off big as she ranked first in Worldwide Open, Regional Open, and United States.</p><h3>The Injury Curse Strikes</h3><p>However, constantly performing for more than three years had taken a toll on her body. Additionally, she had soreness in her shoulder blades while competing in the 2017 games.</p><p>She had cracked her rib and missed the rest of the 2018 season. A late diagnosis made the fracture to the ribs more persistent.</p><p>She tried to come back to the scene, believing she was fitter than ever. But, she never showed the prime Sara we knew.</p><p>Sara ranked 19th in the CrossFit games 2019, her worst in five years. Yet, she worked hard and bounced back, ranking first in the Worldwide Open and Iceland the same year.</p><p>Sara felt she was covering grounds as she went on to win the 2020 Dubai CrossFit Championship. But disaster struck yet again as she tore a ligament in her knee while training in 2021.</p><p>As per South China Morning Post, Sara said she felt a quick click on her knee and immediately went to an MRI. Unfortunately, her ACL had burst, and she had to get surgery.</p><p>As of now, she is currently resting entirely to return more robust in the upcoming games.
