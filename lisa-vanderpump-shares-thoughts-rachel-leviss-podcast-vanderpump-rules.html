In the premiere episode, she opened up about why she chose not to return to the series in the wake of Scandoval.</p><p>"I don't want to be with Tom and I've made the decision to cut Tom out of my life," she said of why she turned down Season 11. "Going back to do the show, it would force me to interact with him ... and I know I'm on the outskirts with all the other cast, so I wouldn't get my story across."</p><p>"I really believe the girls wouldn't give me the time of day to let me open up to them, given my previous history with my interactions with them," she added, before saying that she did consider returning while she was in treatment for her mental health after the scandal blew up.</p><p>"I had become the worst version of myself through the 7 months of secrecy, deception and going along with these lies that ate me up. And part of that is my fault ... and it was a really bad choice," she said. "But I was still in relationship with Tom, we were talking on the phone when I went in for treatment and in those months I was in there, I was debating whether or not to do the show."</p><p>In the end, she felt she was watching "the worst version" of herself when revisiting Season 10 and now believes she "made the right decision by leaving."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Rachel has continued to share her side of the story about the scandal and relationship with Sandoval on her podcast, even suggesting the TomTom co-owner may have <a href=#><strong>"masterminded" the affair </strong></a>to boost VPR ratings.</p><p>Last month, she <a href=#><strong>hit back</strong></a> at her former Pump Rules costar <a href=#><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a><strong> </strong>after she criticized Rachel Goes Rogue and claimed that people are going to "get real tired" hearing her talking about Scandvoal on her platform.</p><p>Rachel shared an Instagram post to announce that Episode 10 of her podcast<strong> </strong>had been released, and used the opportunity to call out Scheana after she slammed her iHeartRadio podcast ... and Rachel brought the receipts.</p><p>The video began with a clip of Scheana talking to Vanderpump Rules costars <a href=#><strong>Lala Kent</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>James Kennedy</strong></a> about Rachel's podcast.</p><p>"I'm curious what Episode 10 of her podcast is gonna be because everyone's gonna get real tired hearing her just talk about Tom Sandoval," Scheana said, to which Lala added sarcastically, "Sounds like such an interesting podcast."</p><p>It then cut to an edited compilation video that featured over two dozen clips of Scheana mentioning Sandoval on her podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Scheanaigans</strong></a>, as well during other podcast interviews.</p><p>"Chapter 10 of Rachel Goes Rogue is out now #rachelgoesrogue," Rachel captioned her post, which featured a photo of a Mean Girls Burn Book for its cover image.</p><a id=gallery-link-92ddbedc-6f25-4503-8d0a-fe7f57e22457 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:92ddbedc-6f25-4503-8d0a-fe7f57e22457 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:70f74cd5-4993-42de-abb3-2734cb885861 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/95/4by3/2024/01/18/95bfc95d84c44b92ad6ff649dd00f1a9_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2xmaW1foba0rYyvmKeclae9trnPZqqhmaKawG7Ax6isoKCkqHqzrcKhnKVlnJrDqr%2FSZqeonJOWwLV51ZqlnZ2ipcKuvIyrrKWdo2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./local-events.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Local Events | leader-call.com</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-ballard-age-family-net-worth-height-is-he-mormon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Get To Know Tim Ballard Age, Family, Net Worth, Height, Mormon</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
