The chorus features Taylor contemplating whether or not she should stay in the relationship, as she sings, “Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?” <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Toward the end of the track, the “Cruel Summer” artist reveals she wanted marriage, but the person she is singing about did not. “And I wouldn’t marry me either / A pathological people pleaser / Who only wanted you to see her,” she adds in another verse.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“How long could we be a sad song / ‘Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?” Taylor continues in the last verse. “I gave you all my best me’s, my endless empathy / And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier / Fighting in only your army / Frontlines, don’t you ignore me, I’m the best thing at this party.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Entertainment Tonight</i></a> reported that the split “was more of Taylor’s decision to break up, but both of them realized that they weren’t completely right for one another.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Taylor and Joe are in totally different places in their lives right now,” a source told the outlet in April, shortly after the pair called it quits. “They had been together for such a long time and were spending so much time together, but their personalities were just too different. Joe is more introverted, shy and quiet.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Were Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn Engaged?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Throughout their six-year relationship, multiple outlets reported that the then-couple were engaged at one point. In 2022, sources told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Life & Style </i></a>that Taylor and Joe were engaged, but neither the pop singer nor the <i>Mary Queens of Scots</i> actor publicly confirmed whether they were engaged or not.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>However, Joe played it coy during an interview with <i>WSJ Magazine</i> that year.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>If I had a pound for every time I think I’ve been told I’ve been engaged, then I’d have a lot of pound coins,” he joked before adding, “I mean, the truth is, if the answer was ‘yes,’ I wouldn’t say, and if the answer was ‘no,’ I wouldn’t say.”</p><h2>Who Is Taylor Swift Dating Now?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-12><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Following her split</a> from Joe, Taylor was briefly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>romantically linked</a> with The 1975’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Matty Healy</b></a>, but that fizzled out a month later. Throughout September and October, though, the “Bad Blood” singer was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seen cheering</a> on NFL player <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Travis Kelce</b></a> at three of his football games. While their romance is only starting out, music and sports fans have expressed their support for the duo.<span class=Apple-converted-space> The two even made brief cameos on Saturday Night Live together before being spotted holding hands. During that episode of SNL, the cast</span> referred to her breakup from Joe, with one speculating whether her hit “Karma” was about the actor.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“‘Karma’ isn’t about Joe! Are you insane? Not everything has to be about Joe,” comedian <strong>Mikey Day</strong> said in the sketch.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Travis has spoken out about his newfound relationship with Taylor but <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>made it a point</a> that he would refrain from commenting about it too much in order to “respect” her privacy.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahsGacmZl6ta3YpaarZaOstqfAjJqlnWWapLJurcuwsKdlkqeyoreMrqdmoZ6otqWxjK2fnqGiYsCxuMitZG5pZ2V%2Bc4SO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./daniel-radcliffes-height-weight-and-body-measurements.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Daniel Radcliffes Height, Weight And Body Measurements</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kina-kai.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Kina Kai dating?
