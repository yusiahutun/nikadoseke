Others were managerial staff, interns and business partners.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The personal data stolen included names, as well as ID card and passport numbers, while some victims had their financial information such as bank account numbers, medical reports, photos, birth dates, social media accounts and academic information leaked.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thirteen Windows systems and two virtual servers were compromised.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chung said Cyberport contravened two principles of personal data protection laws by not keeping information secure and keeping it over the intended retention period, which warranted an enforcement notice.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The earliest case we know of dates back to 2016, when the person concerned had sought employment with the company, but their data was kept ever since, until the incident happened,” Chung said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The commissioner added that Cyberport’s data retention policy stipulated that jobseekers’ personal information would be kept for one year after their application, while that of staff would only be retained during their employment period.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/02/11a09313-da42-40f5-8428-02849ebe8ce7_53a38b5c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the tech hub has been unable to explain why it kept thousands of former candidate and staff files beyond their intended storage periods.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[Cyberport] had only discovered the unnecessary retention of data upon the discovery of the data breach incident, so they were unable to provide an explanation for failing to delete the data in question,” Chung said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“However, the crucial point of our investigation is not why they had failed to do so, but that they had failed to do so. The net result is what we are looking for, and [that] demonstrates a contravention of the Privacy Data Ordinance.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cyberport lost more than 400GB of data, including bank account information and ID card soft copies, in the cyberattack but did not reveal the number of victims last year.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong’s Cyberport apologises over data theft, vows to improve security</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The firm only disclosed the incident in September, when cybersecurity information platform FalconFeedsio said on its social media page that ransomware group Trigona had added Cyberport to its list of victims.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chung revealed that Trigona had first gained access to an administrator account of Cyberport’s network on August 6 through brute force attacks, where hackers would try to guess an account’s password. Hackers then proceeded to disable Cyberport’s antivirus software before launching further attacks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eight days later on August 14, Cyberport noticed its files being attacked and maliciously encrypted. It tried to fix the situation by changing passwords for all accounts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But on August 17, the company received Trigona’s demand for ransom payment before being attacked the next day.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The watchdog’s investigation also uncovered multiple loopholes and blunders in the firm’s cybersecurity measures, from inadequate protection to vague policy terms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among the 13 compromised Windows systems, one of them was found to have been put to use without a prior cybersecurity risk assessment or security audit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cyberport was also discovered to have relied on one antivirus program to protect its vast network, which Chung called “insufficient and disproportionate”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Multi-factor authentication, which requires users to provide two or more different pieces of information to gain access to a computer system, was also not in use.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong school told to review data policy after alleged student privacy breach</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chung said that inadequacy allowed Trigona hackers to gain complete control over an administrator account once they had guessed the correct password during their brute force attacks in August.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Investigations also showed that Cyberport’s most recent security audit took place at the end of 2021, more than a year before the breach, leading the privacy watchdog to criticise the firm’s practice of conducting security assessments every two years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chung also said Cyberport’s network security policy was too general, lacking operational guidelines for employees to follow.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In their policy, they said they would conduct ‘regular antivirus checks’, but they only said ‘regular’ without detailing how frequent these checks would be,” the commissioner noted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Under the watchdog’s enforcement notice, Cyberport will need to perform a series of security checks and reinforcements, implement multi-factor verification procedures, hire an independent security expert for annual audits and lay out clear guidelines for the prevention, detection and response to cybersecurity threats by May 20.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cyberport promised on Tuesday to upgrade its defence capabilities against online attacks. It said a task force set up following the incident last year had found “room for improvement” in the hub’s information security and data management. It had reinforced “multiple measures to enhance the calibre and awareness of information system security and data security at all operational levels”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Cyberport has also reviewed and strengthened measures for personal information management to ensure compliance with personal information protection principles outlined in the [privacy law],” it said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong privacy watchdog probes data breach at prominent sports club</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Francis Fong Po-kiu, honorary president of the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation, said he was surprised by Cyberport’s weak defences against a brute force attack.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fong two-factor authentication would have required users to follow up a login attempt with a physical key or biometric scan. He said Cyberport could have limited the number of login attempts or locked down an account after too many attempts at entry were recorded.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also proposed the hub conduct a security audit every three to six months.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lawmaker Duncan Chiu, who represents the technology and innovation sector in the legislature, said the theft of data had underscored the need for more resources to be devoted to cybersecurity at organisations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">IT veteran Joseph Leung Wai-fung said the incident could damage the image of Cyberport both locally and internationally as it was at the forefront of the information technology industry in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The incident does not tell a good story to companies looking for digital transformation,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoo5qvXZa7pXnCq6CmnV%2BWv7W1wqWcaGtiaoR2gZdon6iml2K4sLrGZpqympWnvbC%2B02abmqyRYq%2BzscCcn2akkajBbsXEmqlmmZabsqTAxJ1kamtmaH9uv9OanZ9lkaOxbrbOm6qenZuav7R5z6ugr5mTrnq4rdOcn52nl2LAosXS</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./iran-tv-station-boss-fired-after-jackie-chan-sex-scene-slips.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jackie Chan sex scene costs Iran TV station boss his job after it slips through censors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ganni-new-balance-collab-2023.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ganni x New Balance Collab Again for 2023 Here's How to Shop It</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
