Faced with the idea of being trapped inside a two-bedroom apartment all summer, my boyfriend and I decided to head to my parents’ house in Illinois to save on rent. At first, we thought we might stay for a month or two, but as the situation worsened across the country, it became clear that we might be here for a while.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Celebrities began going live on Instagram relentlessly, plans were being canceled, and friends and family members were getting sick. By May, I was emotionally drained from the horror of it all, working from home full-time and ready to put my energy into something that I could look forward to. With courage and some saved rent money, I started looking for a plastic surgeon.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>As I got older, I mostly just felt annoyed by my nose, like it was getting in the way of the rest of my face.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The first time I recall feeling self-conscious about my nose was when a guy I was dating said it was one of the first things he noticed about me. “I thought you were a pretty girl, but you had a nose,” he said. He didn’t mean it maliciously; it was more matter-of-fact.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I knew I had a big nose with a signature Sicilian bump on the bridge, but I had always just seen it as a part of me, a familial link. That cartilage-filled link included a slew of sinus issues and a special bonus of chronic nosebleeds that got increasingly worse. During the dry months of the year, I’d have to regularly excuse myself from work to sit in a bathroom stall and wait for them to pass. As I got older, I mostly just felt annoyed by my nose, like it was getting in the way of the rest of my face. This idea was only reinforced when mask wearing became mandatory and I basked in the pleasure of my least-favorite feature being hidden.</p><img alt=before title=before width=1080 height=139 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/untitled-2-01-1597178278.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60"></h2><img alt=before title=before width=1080 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/front-3-edit-1597171444.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">COURTESY</span></p><img alt="before side" title="before side" width=1080 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/left-1-1597171494.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">COURTESY</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nose jobs are pricey in New York City, with the average cost coming in at around $10,000 to $15,000. But in Chicago, where I’m staying, the average price is closer to between $5,000 and $9,000. So I knew that if I wanted to go through with the procedure, now was the time. A friend with experience in plastic surgery recommended a surgeon, and I scheduled a consultation for June 12. The first visit was over the phone, and I was not able to meet the doctor prior to the day of surgery because of COVID-19. Initially, I was alarmed that some guy who I’d never even met was going to change my face forever. But I also knew that he had 30 years of experience and meeting me once before surgery wasn’t going to change his ability to do his job.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On our first call, I explained that I liked my nose overall and I wanted to just get rid of the bump. I felt a twang of guilt as I said the words out loud. Was I being too vain, especially given the state of the world? Although I had been saving for this and had a unique opportunity to work from home indefinitely during the recovery, I knew it was a risky time to spend so much money on something I didn’t necessarily need.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Was I being too vain, especially given the state of the world?<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After that, everything happened quickly. The surgeon had an opening in two weeks, so I booked it. I felt a sense of urgency once I made up my mind to go through with it; COVID-19 had created such a dynamic and uncertain environment that I was afraid the country would shut down again before I could have the procedure. After seeing renderings of the before and expected after looks during my final televisit with the surgeon, I was relieved. I still looked like myself, just sans bump.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the weeks leading up to the surgery, the country began reopening, but I stayed inside. I stayed up late scrolling through Reddit threads about celebrity nose jobs and ordering dry-mouth spray for the impending weeks of mouth breathing. I was required to get tested for COVID five days before the surgery to ensure that I was negative. My old nose’s last outing was to get tickled with a nasal swab at one of the huge drive-in National Guard testing sites.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The first time I met my doctor in person was 15 minutes before surgery. He was professional and approachable. He calmly reviewed his plans for my nose with me, and I reiterated that I did not want to look elvish. I was there alone, as my family was not allowed to come into the surgery center due to COVID precautions. This was without a doubt the most nerve-racking part of the entire experience. My mom is a nurse, and I usually rely on her to ask the right questions before a big medical procedure. Even though this was a fairly routine elective procedure, there was still something unsettling about not having a companion and advocate by my side.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The surgery took only about two hours, and before I knew it, I was back at home recovering quarantine-style. I slept a lot, laid in bed, and played The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to pass the hours. My surgeon explained that there aren’t many nerves in our noses, so most of the discomfort post-op came from the swelling around my eyes and having to sleep on my back while slightly elevated. I was so disfigured in early recovery that it was difficult for me to process that I had a new nose underneath the splint and bandages.</p><img alt=after title=after width=1080 height=139 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/untitled-2-02-1597178296.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt=after title=after width=1080 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/after-front-1597178720.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">COURTESY</span></p><img alt=after title=after width=1080 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/after-side-1597178731.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">COURTESY</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At my first post-op appointment eight days later, my doctor removed the splint, and I started happily weeping at the sight of my new nose. He informed me that I had “big bones” (a good excuse I’ll keep in my back pocket from now on) and that contributed to the bruising and swelling I would experience during the healing process. In general, I felt a sense of relief, like this thing that I had loathed for so long was suddenly just gone and I could let go of the weight of that insecurity.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My nose is still swollen, of course. The initial swelling will last for a few months, and I won’t see the full results for about a year. I am almost a month post-op and don’t regret a single thing about my decision. My experience with cosmetic surgery has been empowering. It has allowed me to take control of my body image and enhance parts of myself that I already loved.</p><img alt="before and after" title="before and after" width=1081 height=139 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/untitled-2-03-1597178309.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img alt="side by side" title="side by side" width=1080 height=1390 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sidebyside-1597175247.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">COURTESY</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It takes courage to make a permanent change to one’s body—and a little extra courage to do it while the world is in crisis. Now that the bump is gone, I don’t hate old photos of myself; I just think of my current look as the 2.0 version of my face: updated features, new system capabilities, and hopefully less nosebleeds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqGdkaHBqXvAbGpuaWJsfnh7zaiqnmWapK9usNSroKefXZi8t7XDZqiumaKWu7W1zZ5m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./545072-kevin-hines-story-survive-a-jump-golden-gate-bridge.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kevin Hines story: Did he really survive a jump from the Golden Gate Bridge?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hozier-girlfriend-gay-dating-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hozier Bio, Girlfriend, Gay, Age, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
