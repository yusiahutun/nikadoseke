The only thing really worth mentioning is the material the cards are made out of. Your most common materials are paper and plastic. Paper can be the cheapest option, and also the lowest quality, but there are also paper decks that use thicker paper, which will stand the test of time. Plastic decks tend to last longer, but many don't like the feel compared to paper, so that's really just up to you. We'll make a note for each deck stating what the cards are made out of.</p><p>So, with that covered, let's look at some cool and unique playing cards.</p><h3 id=update-12-11-21>UPDATE: 12/11/21</h3><p>Verified content still accurate.
