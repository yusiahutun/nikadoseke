Prepare for your next online meet-cute with these pods.</p><h2>Armchair Expert</h2><p>Hosted by Parenthood actor Dax Shepard, “Armchair Expert” dives into more than love. The podcast explores the messiness, vulnerability, struggles and shortcomings that make humans, well, humans. What makes Shepard an expert to examine human psychology? Well, nothing really (other than his Anthropology degree), but the actor accomplishes this feat through charm and relatability. The episodes also include interviews from some of Shepard’s famous friends, including Sheryl Crow, Alicia Keys and, obvi, his wife Kristen Bell.</p><h2 class=p1>Monica & Jess Love Boys</h2><p>“Monica & Jess Love Boys” is a series from “Armchair Expert” where Monica Padman, Shepard’s “Armchair Expert” cohost, and her friend, Jess, talk about everything relationships. Despite their friendship, Monica and Jess are polar opposites when it comes to love. Jess dates too much, whereas Monica dates too little. Jess is gay, whereas Monica is straight. Still, with the help of other relationship experts, the two do well to explore societal and individual patterns when it comes to dating. At the end of each episode, Monica and Jess are given a challenge to break their bad dating habits in true “Armchair Expert” fashion.</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>Modern Love</span></h2><p>“Modern Love” has been a column in The New York Times for years. Each week, the column tells the story of a different relationship and how they’re surviving in the modern age. (The column was even turned into a TV show on Amazon in 2019.) As for the “Modern Love” podcast, the episodes feature performances from actors, such as Kate Winslet, Jake Gyllenhaal, Uma Thurman and Sterling K. Brown, as they read true and raw stories about love, loss and redemption from the column that started it all.</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>Help! I Suck at Dating</span></h2><p>Bachelorette alums Dean Unglert (from Rachel Lindsay’s season) and Jared Haibon (from Jojo Fletcher’s season) host one of the best dating podcasts in Bachelor Nation. There are a lot of love podcasts in the Bachelor world (the “Viall Files” from Nick Viall; “Almost Famous” by Ashley Iaconetti and Ben Higgins” but “Help! I Suck at Dating” is by far one of the best. The episodes feature Dean and Jared interview guests, experts, psychics and celebrity friends (including their Bachelor Nation buddies) as they figure out this thing called love.</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>Call Your Girlfriend</span></h2><p>Rather than romantic love, “Call Your Girlfriend,” hosted by Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow explores female friendships. With new episodes every Friday, the hosts encourage their listeners to call their “girlfriends,” no matter how long distance their friendship is. Of course, there’s also dating talk. But the bulk of the episodes deal with how friendships are equally as important as relationships.</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>Why Won’t You Date Me?&nbsp;</span></h2><p>Comedian Nicole Byers became an internet favorite with Netflix’s Nailed It, and, as expected, she’s just as funny and relatable in her podcast, “Why Won’t You Date Me?” As the podcast explains, Byers has ben single for decades, and she doesn’t really know why. And so she created a podcast as an effort to answer that question each week. With the help of her comedian friends and an ex-lover or two, Byes’ dating podcast will make you laugh and cry.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/banner-newsletter.jpg alt="StyleCaster Banner Newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZ6Yra2imnytu9WeZKmnlJiutMDSZmhqaGhugXp7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./holly-willoughby-instagram-truly-itv-16879455.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Holly Willoughby goes TOPLESS as she reveals new project</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10-inspiring-idioms-pixar-films-encanto-finding-nemo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 inspiring idioms from Pixar films, from Encanto to Finding Nemo - YP</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
