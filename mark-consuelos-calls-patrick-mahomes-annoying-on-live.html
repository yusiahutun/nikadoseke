That quarterback Mahomes is so good, it’s annoying,” the Riverdale actor said during the conversation with his wife. Mark assured the audience that he was impressed by the professional athlete’s skill, despite the subtle dig.</p><p>“He seems like a wonderful man. Wonderful guy,” he continued. “You got to marvel at his prowess athletically. He’s fantastic, but he’s just so good. He’s so good.”</p><p>Just as Mark was continuing his rant about Patrick, 28, an audience member chimed in with their opinion. “He’s very cute,” the person said from the crowd, to which Mark replied, “And he’s very cute. Oh OK, well OK.”</p><p>The All My Children actor was visibly thrown off by the comment, shaking his head in the direction of the camera.</p><p>“They made it to the … I was going to say the World Series. It’s not the World Series,” he continued after the fan interrupted him. “They made it to the Super Bowl. They beat the Ravens. Last night, the Lions, America’s team against the 49ers, they came out and punched the 49ers in the face.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mark-Consuelos-Calls-Patrick-Mahomes-‘Annoying-on-Live-1.jpg><p>Kelly, 53, asked, “Have you checked on my dad?” The Generation Gap host’s father, <strong>Joseph Ripa</strong>, is a big Detroit Lions fan. Mark replied, “No,” and finished off the segment by congratulating the two teams that will be duking it out at the Super Bowl.</p><p>Mark is famously a huge fan of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, while Kelly roots for the Philadelphia Eagles. Throughout the NFL season, the longtime couple have smack talked each other’s teams on Live and made several bets with each other.</p><p>After the Buccaneers beat the Eagles in the NFL Wildcard Round, Kelly lost a bet with her husband and was <a href=#>forced to eat a Cuban sandwich</a> on Live with producer <strong>Ashley Lewis</strong>.</p><p>“Ash said to me last night, she goes, ‘I really don’t feel like eating a Cuban sandwich at 9:00 in the morning. And I go, ‘Nobody does!’” the Emmy winner told the crowd on January 16.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmKujXZi8r7%2FUnqOoq12Yrq240manmqyinrCsecyan6illah6orrNqLCippdivK95y6Ktnmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./georgia-girl-17-disappeared-grandparents-home-four-months-ago-safe-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Missing Georgia girl, 17, found safe after four months</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./use-chatgpt-with-excel.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to Use ChatGPT With Excel and Get Over Your Spreadsheet Fears</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
