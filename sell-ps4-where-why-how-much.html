Are you sure you want to sell your PS4? Where's the best place to sell it? How much money will you get?</p><p>Here's what you'll need to know if you're looking to sell your PS4.</p><h2 id=why-would-you-want-to-sell-your-ps4>Why Would You Want to Sell Your PS4?</h2><p>There are some good reasons to sell your PS4. Though you might have a specific one in mind, here's a list that might strengthen the case:</p><ul><li>To contribute towards a PS5.</li><li>If you're looking to move over to Xbox.</li><li>To contribute towards bills.</li><li>You barely use your PS4.</li><li>You use your PS4 too much, and it's negatively impacting other parts of your life.</li></ul><p>Any of these reasons provide a suitable case to sell your PS4. That being said, always consider both sides of the argument—you don't want to sell your PS4 only to regret it later on.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Reasons You Should Keep Hold of Your PS4</a></span></p><h2 id=where-can-you-sell-your-ps4>Where Can You Sell Your PS4?</h2><p>Once you're absolutely sure that you want to sell your PS4, let's look at the various places you can head to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=brick-and-mortar-stores>Brick and Mortar Stores</h3><p>First, you've got the more traditional option—physical stores.</p><p>The process here is pretty simple: think of any physical store near you that'll accept your PS4, contact them to get a quote or get one when you bring your PS4, and sell your PS4 for cash or store credit.</p><p>If you're not a fan of making numerous accounts and detailing your PS4 on each one, or you have a specified time frame for when you want your PS4 sold, then a physical store might be your best bet. You also bypass all the waiting that comes with selling on sites like eBay.</p><p>The only downside is that you can't set or negotiate a price, and it's usually not the best, as these stores also want to sell your PS4 for profit. Oh, and these businesses might sell PS5s and Xbox Series X/Ss at inflated prices. <strong>Not</strong> cool.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Check You're Not Buying Your PS5 or Xbox Series X From a Scalper</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=online-trade-in-businesses>Online/Trade-In Businesses</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/decluttr-sell-ps4.png><p>Online or trade-in businesses are similar to physical stores in that you're selling your PS4 to a company that'll give you a quote. The upside is that you can send it from your home, which can be more convenient if your location is a bit remote.</p><p>Most physical stores will have an online opinion, but there are also standalone online stores for this. It's worth your time to do some research and see which one'll give you the most money for your PS4.</p><p>Again, these places are looking to buy and sell your PS4 for profit, so the price you'll receive might not be great. A helpful site is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SellCell</a>; a comparison site where you can check various trust-rated places to sell your PS4, with what prices and perks they offer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=online-marketplaces>Online Marketplaces</h3><p>The third place you can sell your PS4 is an online marketplace, where you're selling directly to individuals.</p><p>Sites like eBay, StockX, and Facebook Marketplace are examples of this. Here, you've got the most control over selling your PS4: you can set the price, showcase the condition, and create custom bundles if you also want to sell any games or accessories.</p><p>While it's more time-consuming to set up than the other two options, you could get the highest price here. But you might have to wait awhile, as no one is guaranteeing that your PS4 will actually sell.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Does Selling on eBay Work, and Can You Really Make Money?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-will-you-get-for-your-ps4>What Will You Get for Your PS4?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ps4-pro-2tb-sold-ebay-1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now onto the most important question—how much money will you get for my PS4?</p><p>As you can guess, prices vary, both from site to site and depending on the make and condition of your PS4. Let's look at some prices for the lowest and highest value PS4 models: the standard 500GB PS4 and the 2TB PS4 Pro.</p><ul><li>At the time of writing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Decluttr</a> (one of the best online businesses) offers you up to $120 for the standard 500GB PS4 and up to $180 for the PS4 Pro 2TB.</li><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Walmart</a>, on the other hand, offers up to $68 and $140, respectively, in the form of Walmart eGift Cards.</li><li>If you want to use eBay, you might be looking at around $150-200+ and $300-400+, respectively, though this includes various bundles.</li><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swappa</a>, says that the average selling price of the 500GB PS4 is $239, with the 2TB PS4 Pro hitting $476.</li></ul><p>This should give you an idea of what to expect: companies, whether online or physical, will offer you less money, but your process is more convenient, and you won't have to wait for a sale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Online marketplaces, on the other hand, can give you a higher sum, but with more hassle for you to set up and no guarantee of a sale. If you're in no rush to sell, then an online marketplace could be ideal for you.</p><p>Remember that the market is very volatile and can change from day to day. That is one upside when you sell to businesses—you can usually get a fixed price for a limited time. It might not be great, but at least it'll be something.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Can the PS5 Be More Successful Than the PS4?</a></span></p><h2 id=do-your-research-when-you-sell-your-ps4>Do Your Research When You Sell Your PS4</h2><p>Selling hardware can be tricky.
