But a hug can mean many things to different people. For example, it could mean the person hugging you has enjoyed your company. Also, a hug from a loved one could be a greeting. In most cases, a hug can signify romantic intimacy, emotional support, <a href=#>security</a>, love, or friendship.

For example, has he sneaked from behind to hug you? Or, is he stroking your back while holding you? Also, a guy can initiate a hug by encircling your lower back with his hands and pulling you tightly towards him.</p><p class=align-left>In other cases, a man can hug you sideways with only one hand on your back.

The embrace is not only tight but also strong. Such a gesture means the guy is into the girl. He is happy to hold the girl tightly and have his arms around her. Also, it means the guy wants the moment to last as long as it will, especially if he accompanies it by closing his eyes.</p><p class=align-left>A tight hug from a man also indicates his feeling towards you. In other words, he feels a strong will to protect and comfort you. The embrace is reassuring and lets the girl know he is committed to her.</p><h2 id=442247-what-does-it-mean-when-a-guy-hugs-you-from-behind class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>What does it mean when a guy hugs you from behind?</h2><p class=align-left>A hug from behind happens when a guy sneaks behind you and puts his arms around your chest or hips. The action is significant to the man because it means he loves you or is in love with you. Furthermore, hugging from behind means the guy is blanketing the girl’s body with his. The guy is trying to communicate that he feels he can be your shelter.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d3497a3f3c893d12.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does it mean when a guy flirts with you but has a girlfriend?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Another reason for the gesture is that he displays his dominance and strength.

Ideally, hugs have different meanings to different people. However, here are five things you should know when a hug initiates a hug.</p><h3 id=442247-1-he-cares-about-you class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>1. He cares about you</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0737f6a297635f0b.jpg><p class=align-left>A guy can initiate a hug by gently stroking your back while holding you. The gesture is affectionate and signifies he cares about you. The back is a vulnerable part of the body that you cannot see.</p><p class=align-left>It is always surprising when somebody touches it. But when a guy softly rubs you on the back, it means he cares about you and wants to protect and nurture you. But sometimes, a guy can stroke a girl’s back when caressing her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/52b14ea7a7c2cacb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does it mean when a guy calls you baby girl? What you should know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The rubbing can be soothing and even turn him on. When that happens, it means he wants you. Also, stroking from behind could mean the guy has come to you for some comfort. Your relationship with him could help you decipher the meaning of the hug.</p><h3 id=442247-2-he-is-being-friendly-to-you class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>2. He is being friendly to you</h3><p class=align-left>When a guy is friendly to you, he will initiate a hug and thumb your upper back. The significance of the hug is that the guy is being friendly to you. In most cases, it happens when a guy hugs you goodbye. Besides, most men hug their buddies that way when they have just met.</p><p class=align-left>If you are in a relationship with a guy, and he thumbs your upper back while hugging you, it means he is no longer into you, and the romance between the two of you is fading. Also, if you have a crush on him and initiate such an embrace, it means he is not interested in having a <a href=#>relationship</a> with you. The gesture can even be more revealing if he does it in private.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e99c66cc474ef907.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs he doesn't care about the relationship and what to do</span></p></a><h3 id=442247-3-he-wants-you class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>3. He wants you</h3><p class=align-left>When a guy hugs you for a long time by encircling your lower back with his hands and pulling you tightly towards you, it means he wants you. If he puts his hand further down your back or body, he is more fired up to be with you. It is crucial to pay attention to this gesture when starting a relationship with him.</p><p class=align-left>Hugging you for a long time and doing it tightly means you are no longer a fling to him. He has already accepted you and is willing to go the extra mile to be with you. Also, the guy feels both of you can connect emotionally and mentally.</p><p class=align-left>Also, if you have noticed that the guy does not hug his friends for a long time but only you, you have won his heart. He is comfortable embracing you that way because he likes being close to you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/582612be59111409.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ cute contact names for your boyfriend in your phone</span></p></a><h3 id=442247-4-he-is-sexually-attracted-to-you class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>4.

The hug can happen in any position, whether seated or standing and take longer than three minutes.</p><p class=align-left>Usually, people hug each other starting from the right side to signify protection. But, unfortunately, that also means both hearts are further away. However, when starting from the left side, the hug is intimate.</p><p class=align-left>An intimate hug from a man who is sexually attracted to you will involve a close and full-body embrace, with deep eye contact. The hug no longer becomes a physical approach but a gesture of something special between you.</p><h3 id=442247-5-he-is-showing-his-sense-of-security class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>5. He is showing his sense of security</h3><p class=align-left>A guy can initiate a hug by grabbing and even picking you up with all his power, desire, and strength. You will even hear him grunting as he squeezes your back because he uses all his energy to give you a good hug. In most cases, you may find yourself reciprocating because you like it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a329d0f18dc6ec02.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 behavioural signs of Taurus man when he likes you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The significance of the hug is that the guy is showing you his sense of security. He is savouring that moment you are together. It also means he has your back and not going anywhere.</p><p class=align-left>What does it mean when a guy initiates a hug? Generally, a guy can initiate a hug for different reasons. For example, a guy can start a hug from behind to show he is into you. Also, he can start a hug because he cares about you. If he pats you on the back during an embrace, it means he is being friendly and not necessarily into you.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> shared an interesting article about, he says <a href=#>he wants to be friends</a> but his actions show different.
