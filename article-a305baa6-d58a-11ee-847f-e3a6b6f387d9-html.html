SJ has been the Class 5A state champion every year since 2019, except for 2020, when the event was canceled by COVID-19.</p><p>The band has established itself as a dynasty, and they are not just tooting their own horn.</p><p>In November, the band won the Bands of America Southeast Regional Championship Bands in Troy, Ala., where they prevailed over elite high school marching bands from five states. It marked the first time a band from Mississippi had won the event in 36 years, and earned the praise of Governor Tate Reeves himself.</p><p>“I’m proud of the way y’all have represented Mississippi!” Reeves wrote on his Facebook page, along with a photo of the band. “Keep up the great work!”</p><p>And the beat goes on. But what is the secret to the success of the band? How has this dynasty been built? The same way all other championship cultures are developed and maintained — hard work. And lots of it.</p><p>During the marching season, passersby will find the band practicing even after school. They march two to three times after school for at least an additional eight hours per week. That work ethic carries on throughout the duration of the school year and summer as well.</p><p>So when the trophies are hoisted, the marching Braves are able to see the rewards of all of that hard work and dedication. It is the same sheet of music and it results in sweet success, year after year.</p><p>“It’s really cool to watch them get excited about their achievements,” said band director Brian Joyce, who has been at the helm for eight years. “We are always proud of the kids. They work hard day in and day out.”</p><p>When the world came to a grinding halt during the pandemic, band members found a way to stay in tune with their competition skills and work ethic. While some may have packed up their instruments and called it a day, members of the Band of Braves found creative ways not just to learn their instruments better, but to even stay sharp in terms and game-ready.</p><p>They created and participated in virtual competitions and kept putting one foot in front of the other. Joyce said that really demonstrated to him the level of passion the band program has established as a part of its culture.</p><p>And once restrictions were lifted, they got the band back together, literally, and never missed a beat.</p><p>“These kids are capable of anything,” Joyce said. He feels that they have been placed in his life for a reason, and each of them have exceeded the expectations of the band staff members, becoming a part of their families.</p><p>“The kids have always done more for me than I’ve ever been able to do for them,” Joyce said. “We love them and care about them as much as we do our very own families.”</p><p>Makenna Bradley is one of those students who has really grown while a member of the group. The SJ drum major says she has learned responsibility and how to overcome challenges more readily as a result.</p><p>“We all want to help each other learn and grow,” Bradley said. Through the experiences and time spent together, she likens her bandmates to “family,” and feels the entire community wants the best for them.</p><p>In 2026, the Band of Braves will be able to get their Irish on, as they have been selected to participate in the St. Patrick’s Day Festival and Parade in Dublin. But for now, this dynasty is already putting in plans, and the work, for next season’s MHSAA marching season.</p><p>- Kirstie Landry contributed</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcL%2FOrquhZZqku6a%2FjJuYp5xdpLNur8eapKmhn6PAcK3RraCcpJWUrnR8lJuYmm5dmYJ5rYxqaJ6dXW2BeLKMnmqabpJrs3SElp1wZ6Ckork%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-macdonald-height-family-dating-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Macdonald Wiki, Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lee-trevino.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lee Trevino</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
