Whether you're committed to DIY-ing your nails, or are trying to cut back on salon visits, achieving a salon-quality gel manicure is possible at home, all thanks to at-home gel nail kits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We set out to find the best at-home gel manicure kits. To do so, we rounded up a handful of testers to research the most popular kits and try them out in our testing lab to determine which ones are worth the splurge. After thorough testing — taking into account ease of use and removal, drying time, quality, and post-mani nail health — we picked the best-performing kits.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-morovan-poly-gel-nail-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Morovan Nail Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Morovan Poly Gel Nail Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OakC4x2ouGgahr90MyKyfQVLjiA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/morovan-poly-gel-nail-kit-71b2aedb967141e689ad87d4b756585f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Time</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Removal</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For someone looking to dip their toes (and fingers) into doing their own gel manicures, this kit is an excellent place to start. The comprehensive set is equipped with all of the essentials you need to prep your nails and craft unique designs from the comfort of your home. With six bottles of regular gel polish and two bottles of temperature-changing ombre polish, you'll never get bored with your nails.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As if the eight polish colors weren't enough, the kit also comes with a selection of embellishments — like flower decals, holographic sequins, and a variety of rhinestones — to seriously upgrade your mani. The kit also includes an acid-free primer, a dehydrator (which prepares nails for gel), a base coat, a top coat, and eight manicure tools (think: nail clipper, buffer, cuticle pusher, and more).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you've ever gotten a gel manicure, then you know that the gel polish needs to cure (aka set) underneath a UV light in order to harden. This kit comes with a professional-grade, 48-watt LED light that offers three timer settings at 5-, 30- and 60-seconds. The heat setting is automated at low, so you can't change it, but, fear not: The tester shares that the light emits moderate warmth, rather than piping hot light.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's pretty incredible that the kit contains everything you could ever need to do a gel manicure, but with that said, it can be overwhelming for a first-timer. Thankfully, it comes with an easy-to-follow guide and has a pretty wide margin for error. The tester notes that, "Regardless of the mistakes I made, the gel came out pretty good."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>LED Light:</strong> Yes | <strong>Nail polish included: </strong>8 | <strong>Features:</strong> Decals, sequins and rhinestones</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-gellen-gel-nail-polish-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gellen Gel Nail Polish Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gellen Gel Nail Polish Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/iLOy1LCfgAtiRMscNup7XJoBjnA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gellen-gel-nail-polish-kit-5efcf35447c24a73bfd48d02388f1421.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Time</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The comment section of this Amazon-favorite gel nail kit is filled with thousands of positive reviews, and according to our tester, it's for good reason. At an affordable price point, you get a powerful 72-watt LED curing light, a removable tray that allows you to do your toes with ease, manicure tools, design accessories, and 12 different polish colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The tester shares that she was pleased with the long term results. "The finish is extremely shiny and the color comes out beautifully," she says. Plus, even after a few weeks of wear, the gel polish didn't damage her natural nails.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing this kit doesn't include: Removal accessories. Thankfully, removal supplies aren't hard to come by — in fact, a trip to the drugstore should do the trick. Sally Hansen Global Ambassador and nail pro <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Madeline Poole</a> previously told InStyle, "You only need pure acetone to effectively and quickly break down the gel polish."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>LED Light:</strong> Yes | <strong>Nail polish included: </strong>12 | <strong>Features:</strong> Powerful curing light</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-sally-hansen-salon-pro-gel-starter-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Beginners</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sally Hansen Salon Pro Gel Starter Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sally Hansen Salon Pro Gel Starter Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/v3Av71AIV-LufBt6_85RU-5sN6Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sally-Hansen-Salon-Gel-Polish-Starter-Kit-812464133b2242608c63082fcdf5b9e5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Time</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A household name, Sally Hansen is a trusted source when it comes to all things nails, so it's no wonder that the brand's at-home gel nail kit is ideal for someone trying to learn the basics. "This kit is perfect for beginners because it involves only three steps and is so simple to follow," our tester shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The kit contains an LED lamp, one polish color, both top and base coats, and nail care essentials like a file and buffer to help shape nails. What makes this kit unique is how fast it works. "The drying time was very quick and it wasn't sticky after the suggested curing time [of 30 seconds]," the tester adds. "It dried hard, smooth and streak-free." Plus, according to the brand, the kit lasts for up to 10 gel manicures, which is a pretty good value for $60 total (and significantly cheaper than visiting the salon where gel manicures can cost upwards of $40 each.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That said, this kit covers the basics and nothing more. While a minimalist might love the fact that there's only one shade, the tester notes that she wishes there were more colors available with the kit. However, you can shop all 21 of the gel polish shades, which are sold separately, at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Sally Hansen</a>. After all, variety is key when it comes to nail polish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>LED Light:</strong> Yes | <strong>Nail Polish Included: </strong>1 | <strong>Features: </strong>Nail care accessories, LED lamp</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-polish-essie-gel-couture-longwear-nail-polish></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Polish</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Essie Gel Couture Nail Polish</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Essie Gel Couture Longwear Nail Polish" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VvQFbgtNjS4BgNGzyvEawEaRRP8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Essie-Gel-Couture-bad2ffbb031f436399a91d427af43713.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're hesitant to use an LED light, skip the curing step and try this swipe-and-go option. The application is the same as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>traditional nail polish</a>: All you have to do is paint on two coats of an Essie gel shade (there are plenty to choose from) and top it with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>gel topcoat</a>. Because there are only two pieces in this set, it's a great option if you want to avoid cluttering your beauty space.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from being a quick and convenient way to get a gel mani at home, the results speak for themselves. "My nails look like they got professionally done," our tester says. "Even after 2+ weeks, there is very minimal chipping."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The praise for this kit doesn't stop at the simple application and longevity either. The removal process also couldn't be easier. The polish comes off with regular acetone polish remover you can find at the drugstore. The tester says, "I loved that I didn't need to go to a manicurist for removal and that taking off the gel took the same amount of time as regular polish." Some gel polish has the tendency to make nails weaker, but after removal the tester mentioned that her nails were still in tip-top shape.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's worth noting that because there's no curing process involved, the final result isn't as hard as a typical gel manicure. The reviewer didn't seem to mind, though, given that the polish stayed intact without it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>LED Light:</strong> No | <strong>Nail Polish Included: </strong>1 | <strong>Features:</strong> Top coat included</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-damaged-nails-zoya-gelie-cure-foundation-pro-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Damaged Nails</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Zoya Gelie-Cure Foundation Pro Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Naked Manicure Gelie-Cure Foundation Pro Kit " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DkQ6z9T8mwONt3ZNIY3VNx5MR-c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gelie-cure-foundation-pro-kit-528a5f0bfbd6410caea7310957893157.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ZOYA</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Drying Time</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you suffer from brittle, cracked nails, try this kit that helps restore them during wear. The tester shares that after removing the polish, her nails were "totally healthy and moisturized."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Each kit comes with everything you need for a damage-free, clear gel manicure, including the brand's patented nail rescue serum and reparative <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>base coat</a>, clear gel polish (a plethora of color options is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">sold separately</a>), clear shine polish, polish remover, a nail file, a cuticle pusher, soak-off nail foils, cotton balls, and a travel-size LED light. Best of all, the kit doesn't skimp on quality. "The base polish dries quickly and the clear gel easily spreads across each nail," the tester says.

"The multiple layers of polish make the manicure feel wet and tacky even after drying under the LED light for the recommended 60 seconds," the tester admits.

Even our tester, a self-proclaimed manicure amateur, says the kit is like a party in a box.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's not only nice to look at — the entire process is a breeze, too. Our tester notes that she was shocked at how fast the LED light cures each nail. "My nails look fantastic even though my hands are far from steady," she shares. "The quality of the gel and the curing process covered my many mistakes and the cuticle tool was great at removing polish from my skin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because of the kit's miniature size, you can only cure one nail at a time.

After honing in on online ratings, we spent a total of 54 hours putting the 9 most popular kits to the test in our lab and at-home. We had each of our testers try the kits so that they could analyze the performance of each one and write down their insights in the process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In doing so, our testers rated each at-home kit on a scale of 1 to 5 for six key categories: ease of use, drying time, overall look, quality, ease of removal, and nail integrity post-removal. After initial application, our testers wore their gel manicures for two weeks to evaluate the long wear claims, then removed to review that process as well. Once all the data was collected, we were able to narrow down the original pool of products to the top six at-home gel nail kits.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Curing Lamp</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to gel manicures, an LED curing lamp is key. There's essentially no other way to harden the gel which gives the manicure its signature rock-solid finish. Our Best Overall pick, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Morovan Poly Gel Nail Kit</a>, comes with a professional-grade, 48-watt LED light to cure nails. With that said, check whether or not the kit you're eyeing requires a lamp. If it does, opt for a kit that contains one, otherwise you'll need to purchase one separately. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Julie Kandalec</a>, a professional nail artist who has worked with celebs like Sydney Sweeney, Mariah Carey, and Jessica Chastain, tells InStyle that every product and manufacturer line has its own base coat, top coat gel colors, and lamps, so you should only go with the lamp that the manufacturer recommends. "You shouldn't mix products or lamps because some of them have a higher or lower output which can cause under- or over-curing of the gel," she explains.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Type of Use</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking for an option to tide you over in between nail appointments, it might not be worth splurging on a full kit, and instead, may want to opt for a gel polish (like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Essie Gel Couture Longwear</a>). On the other hand, if you're committed to DIY-ing your nails and cutting back on salon visits, investing in a quality kit is essential. Part of the latter category?

Gel manicures also grow out or need to be fully removed, whereas a regular manicure can chip and wear off with use.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How long do gel manicures last?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When prepped and applied properly, gel manis can last up to a month, or until your nails are grown out. "The longevity of a gel mani can also depend on how active you are with your hands and how well you take care of them," Stone says. When it comes to nail care, Kandalec recommends using <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cuticle oils</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hand lotion</a> to maintain the integrity of your manicure at home.

"One way to prevent damage is to visit a reputable salon that doesn't rush the removal process." Gel needs to soak for at least 20 minutes and should never be peeled or picked off, she adds. To <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>remove gel polish at home</a>, Poole explained to InStyle that you should start by buffing the top layer of your mani with a coarse nail file. Then, soak cotton balls in acetone, secure them to each nail with aluminum foil and wait 10 to 15 minutes. "The gel manicure should slide off with the cotton ball when you remove the foil, but if some residue remains stuck on your nail, use an orangewood stick to work it off," she said.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are gel manicure curing lamps bad for you?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While lamps do produce UV light, the FDA views nail lamps as low risk when used as directed by the label.
