He was <a href=# rel=nofollow>fired</a> from the cast following backlash over transphobic and racist jokes, and mentioned him leaving Saturday Night Live in his monologue. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> joked to the crowd: “If you don’t know who I am, please don’t Google that”. So he was aware what his appearance on the comedy <a href=#>TV</a> series would bring. But he seemed uncomfortable in front of the camera, which was definitely picked up by viewers.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shane-gillis-knew-crowd-wasn-t-enjoying-his-snl-monologue>Shane Gillis’ knew crowd wasn’t enjoying his SNL monologue</h2><p>After getting over the initial hump, he joked “every little boy is just their mom’s gay best friend” and said people with Down syndrome, including relatives, are the happiest people he’s ever met. But he joked he “dodged” Down syndrome, saying it “nicked him” instead. And when he used the word “r******e” in another quip it didn’t really get a response.</p><p>It appeared to get awkward, and he mentioned it as well.</p><p>Shane Gillis then made a comment about the SNL lighting: “This place is extremely well-lit. I can see everyone not enjoying it”.</p><p>He also claimed he didn’t have “any material that can be on TV” and he was “trying” his best. But it still wasn’t hitting.</p><p>Now, a clip showing a musician in the background has gone viral, as she sits straight-faced behind the comedian.</p><p>It’s seen more than 300,000 views since it was uploaded, and looks like she’s not happy with Shane.</p><p>One said: “She was unreasonably salty,” and another added: “That head angle and smirk is perfection…”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-there-was-one-joke-people-seemed-to-like>There was one joke people seemed to like</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Perhaps the fact Shane Gillis was fired from SNL only days after being announced as a cast member was too much for audiences to bear.</p><p>One thing, it seems the mom joke hit home with fans on YouTube though. But they also felt the awkwardness as well.</p><p>One viewer said: “The little hand wave at the end seals it too lolol. Like he’s looking at his parents like “ehhh””</p><p>A second said: “That mom joke hit home more than any joke I’ve ever heard in my life”</p><p>And someone else wrote: “The moms little gay best friend joke – hits home and wish she was still here so I could show her the joke. Brought a happy tear to my eye.”</p><p>While a fourth penned: “I don’t know if I’ve ever watched a monologue where the band WASN’T laughing. Dead inside. Woof. hahaha”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eDcL%2FHmqWeZZeeua210maqp6Rdoryvu8uonq6dXaKypsDSZpuemZRiwKq4xKerZpuipMSlecGuq2annpp6q7vKnmSprZyhsqV506GpqK2XnXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-mind-blowing-facts-about-loch-venachar.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Mind-blowing Facts About Loch Venachar</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./salvage-hunters-star-admits-new-31111517.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Salvage Hunters star admits new life 'cost all his money' after huge decision</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
