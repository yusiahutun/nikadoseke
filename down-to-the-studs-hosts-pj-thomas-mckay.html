Read on for a few fun facts about the hosts.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="article-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">1. It's different from other home renovation shows.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Down to the Studs is not your standard flip show. The most obvious difference is, of course, the husband-and-husband hosts. But in addition to PJ and Thomas, the series stars Thomas' sister, Sydney (also gay and engaged to a woman named Alice), and their funny British neighbor, Tania. Each host has a distinct personality, and it shows from the very first episode.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="article-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">2. Their style is traditional and cozy.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Their style is more traditional than existing HGTV shows, too, favoring walls to open concept floor plans and embracing the challenge of blending vintage with modern. Do some digging on their Instagram to get glimpses of their own home, a stylish, simple space filled with gallery walls and cozy details.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="article-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">3. They were "discovered" on Instagram.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Only a couple months after they started sharing photos of their projects and their life on Instagram, multiple production companies approached PJ and Thomas. They chose Coolfire Studios, filmed a "sizzle" reel, and pitched it to HGTV—and the rest is history.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="article-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">4. PJ and Thomas have been married almost two years.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The two tied the knot October 17, 2015, but they had been together for five years before that. They both asked each other out, and they both proposed.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="article-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">5. And they're totally in love.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Their <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/pjandthomas/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Instagram account" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Instagram account</a> is filled with sweet snapshots and sentiments about their lovely life together. "You are more than just a husband or a best friend or a life partner to me, maybe you're a part of my soul that I couldn't live without and pretty soon the world will find they won't be able to live without you either," Thomas wrote to PJ on his birthday. "You were always meant for greatness, my love, and you deserve the world. I love you baby."</p><h2 data-node-id=39 class="article-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">6. 'Down to the Studs' is making history.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Sure, there are tons of home renovation shows on the network, but this is apparently the first HGTV series with husband-and-husband hosts. "If this show succeeds, it could be huge for the LGBTQ community because this is the first show of its kind on HGTV," the guys wrote in an Instagram caption. "And again, how cool is it that it gets to air during pride month?! We want to thank y'all from the bottom of our hearts for supporting us this whole time and we hope y'all tune in and enjoy the show. We love you."</p><h2 data-node-id=45 class="article-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">7. The show's name has more than one meaning.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The cute play on words obviously refers to stripping a home down to its inner structure, but it's also pretty fitting because, well, if you haven't noticed, these guys are studs.</p><h2 data-node-id=51 class="article-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">8. They each bring something unique to the table.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">PJ, a real estate agent with a degree in construction, has been flipping houses for about ten years now. Thomas, a designer, teamed up professionally a few years ago, and the show follows their work together with the help of their friends.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">[instagram ] <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSAXjgqlKVm/?taken-by=pjandthomas" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSAXjgqlKVm/?taken-by=..." class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">https://www.instagram.com/p/BSAXjgqlKVm/?taken-by=...</a> [/instagram]</p><h2 data-node-id=57 class="article-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">9. They're proud parents to two cute pups.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Named Bean and Teen!</p><h2 data-node-id=63 class="article-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">10. They love 'Fixer Upper' just as much as you do.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=65 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">PJ has been obsessing over Joanna on Instagram since she only had 2,000 followers and "knew she was about to be something big." Now, they're still huge Fixer Upper fans and have referred to Chip and Joanna as "<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/BNalEhugp9m/?taken-by=pjandthomas" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="role models" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">role models</a>".</p><h2 data-node-id=69 class="article-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">11. They're passionate about restoring old homes in their southern town.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=71 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Including the one they currently live in, one of their biggest projects to date. Of course, as you might imagine, PJ and Thomas are often asked what it's like to live and work in a small town in the south as a gay couple. "You'd think with us being in the South that we'd see discrimination a lot, but we actually don't, so we're blessed in that aspect," PJ explained in a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbodJHYR-1s" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="YouTube Q&A video" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">YouTube Q&A video</a>.</p><h6 class="css-5zz7ok e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq e19xk9rq1"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/5b13ab23-04f6-4c1c-a43e-6ded9235e3be_1521574058.jpg alt="Headshot of Taysha Murtaugh" title="Headshot of Taysha Murtaugh" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Taysha Murtaugh was the Lifestyle Editor at CountryLiving.com.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursZyew6q6xmeaqKVfobansY6epa2doqmuqrrMnqWtZ56axLR7wG1qcHBiZLGww81mq6hlpJ2ybr%2FTrpusZZikwLW%2FjKmhZqyYpLqiv4ymmqSZqWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emily-blunt-john-krasinskis-parenting-quotes-about-daughters.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Emily Blunt, John Krasinski's Parenting Quotes About Daughters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-at-home-gel-nail-kits.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 6 Best At-Home Gel Nail Kits of 2024, Tested and Reviewed</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
