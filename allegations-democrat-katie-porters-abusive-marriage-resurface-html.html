Old incidents came to light in divorce filings, with Hoffman alleging Porter dumped a bowl of steaming hot boiled potatoes on his head.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>From 2009 on, Porter was the sole breadwinner, and Hoffman stayed home with the kids. Hoffman insisted that Porter was prone to 'extreme anger' and had a 'history of snapping and screaming at [him] and the children,' and would 'claw and scratch her arms' while blaming him for the markings.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hoffman said Porter frequently said things like 'you f***ing idiot!' and 'you're f***ing incompetent.' 'She would not let me have a cell phone because she said, 'you're too f***ing dumb to operate it,'' Hoffman said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>No confirmed photos of Porter's ex-husband are in circulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Porter said in divorce documents that their marriage had been 'troubled' for four years leading to divorce, but her husband had 'not acted violently' other than one incident years earlier where Hoffman punched a wall until she began the process of leaving him. In a filing, Porter said she and Hoffman had attended anger management classes together in 2009.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But in another instance, Hoffman said that in 2012 Porter came home from work one day enraged that the house was not clean and slammed a glass coffee pot on the counter, causing glass shards to spray everywhere and cut him.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'This house is a mess! You f***ing slob! You're incompetent! What the f*** do you do all day!' Porter allegedly said while the three kids were nearby in the living room. Hoffman said Porter began picking up dishes and saying, 'Look how f***ing dirty this is.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the Spring of 2006, Hoffman said Porter came into the kitchen as he was making mashed potatoes for dinner. As their oldest child Luke sat in the highchair, Porter looked at the potatoes in a ceramic bowl and yelled 'Can't you read the f***ing instructions!'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She then took the ceramic bowl of steaming hot potatoes and dumped it on my head, burning my scalp,' Hoffman said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When the Iowa-born law school professor-turned-outspoken progressive first ran for her seat, she said the divorce and restraining order became a 'whisper campaign' among her primary opponents -- with a rival campaign reportedly telling people something in her divorce documents would disqualify her from running.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So instead of waiting for her dirty laundry to be aired by opponents, Porter went to the media herself.</p><img id=i-265be7b6528a8573 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/11/21/69708659-11934223-image-m-20_1681244168036.jpg height=215 width=634 alt="Revelations from Hoffman's restraining order request against Porter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Revelations from Hoffman's restraining order request against Porter&nbsp;</p><img id=i-8e3a84a592851b49 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/11/01/11/20469904-7638599-House_Democrat_Katie_Porter_wears_batgirl_outfit_for_key_vote_on-a-60_1572607017922.jpg height=1336 width=634 alt="House Democrat Katie Porter wears batgirl outfit on the same day as a key vote on Trump's impeachment inquiry" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>House Democrat Katie Porter wears batgirl outfit on the same day as a key vote on Trump's impeachment inquiry&nbsp;</p><img id=i-dbf1ceaf3615fcd3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/11/14/69703945-11934223-image-a-13_1681221119776.jpg height=448 width=634 alt="Porter hugs her son Luke on the campaign trail in 2018" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Porter hugs her son Luke on the campaign trail in 2018&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'To be made to feel like I've done anything wrong ― I'm just outraged,' Porter told the Huffington Post.

'During the day, I had time to process what happened that morning and more frequently since I filed for divorce,' she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said Hoffman urged her not to call the police - the police had been involved in an altercation of theirs only a month earlier. She said Hoffman told her: 'If I did, our children would go to foster care' and asked if she wanted him to kill himself. 'Is that what you are trying to make happen here?' he allegedly said, according to the restraining order request.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to a police report, when cops came to talk to Hoffman, their seven-year-old Luke told them Hoffman had hit Porter in the past and had kicked him but did not go into detail.</p><img id=i-38c49258b67d718b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/11/21/69708651-11934223-Text_from_Hoffman_s_request_for_a_restraining_order_against_Port-a-8_1681244020976.jpg height=363 width=634 alt="Text from Hoffman's request for a restraining order against Porter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Text from Hoffman's request for a restraining order against Porter&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Porter filed for - and won - a temporary emergency protective order against her husband.
