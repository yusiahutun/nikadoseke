But such phones are also often locked to their network. You can't swap out the SIM card and use a different carrier's network. But you can actually unlock your phone for free or for a small fee, and it can be done legally and risk-free.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We'll cover how to unlock a phone to any network for free, as well as how to get your carrier to unlock your phone for you. Plus, we recommend some of the best paid services to unlock your phone quickly and easily.</p><h2 id=is-it-legal-to-unlock-your-phone>Is It Legal to Unlock Your Phone?</h2><p>The US has flip-flopped on the legality of unlocking phones for some time. But the final verdict by the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) is resoundingly in favor of the consumer. Yes, it is legal to unlock phones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/court-gavel-on-counter.jpg><p>More importantly, the FCC has mandated that all carriers should unlock phones for their consumers for free if a consumer so desires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, you need to know whether your phone can be unlocked. The FCC isn't giving you a free pass to con the carriers. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FCC's guidelines</a> explicitly state that you can unlock the device only "after you have fulfilled the applicable service contract, completed the device installment plan, or paid an early termination fee."</p><p>So, how can you tell if your <a href=#>phone is locked to its network</a> or not? Well, unless you intentionally bought an unlocked phone, it's most likely locked.</p><h2 id=why-should-you-unlock-your-phone>Why Should You Unlock Your Phone?</h2><p>The biggest benefit of unlocked phones is that you are no longer at the mercy of a single provider. You are free to change networks as you see fit, so you can use the SIM that best works for you in any region of the USA.</p><p>Unlocked phones also help tremendously when you're traveling abroad. Land in any country, buy a local SIM card and use it. It's going to be much cheaper than racking up international call and data charges.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, unlocked phones are excellent backup devices. Whether your main phone isn't working or someone needs to borrow a device for a few days, an unlocked device gets the job done.</p><h2 id=what-unlocking-does-and-doesn-39-t-do>What Unlocking Does and Doesn't Do</h2><p>It's pretty simple. SIM unlocking a phone is about letting you use any SIM card from any carrier, as long as it is compatible. You don't get access to any developer features or hidden commands on the phone.</p><p>It cannot break the <a href=#>GSM-CDMA limitations of the phone</a>. So, unlocked phones from GSM networks, such as AT&T and T-Mobile, will let you fit SIM cards from GSM networks. But you can't fit SIMs from CDMA networks, such as Sprint and Verizon, and vice versa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-ways-to-unlock-phones-for-free-or-cheap>3 Ways to Unlock Phones for Free or Cheap</h2><p>Let's say you have a locked mobile phone and want to get it unlocked. You want the safest and least expensive way possible, and maybe even a free phone unlock option. Here's what you can do.</p><h3 id=carrier-unlock-free-service>1. Carrier Unlock (Free Service)</h3><p>The first and best route is to go to your cell service provider for a carrier unlock, also known as a network unlock. Free unlocking services are provided to eligible customers.</p><p>The FCC says, "Participating providers may not charge existing or former customers additional fees to unlock a device if it is eligible to be unlocked. Providers may charge a fee to unlock eligible devices for non-customers and former customers."</p><p>The next obvious thought is, "How do I know if the carrier will unlock my phone free of charge?" Here's how to check if your phone is eligible to be unlocked:</p><ul><li><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">AT&T</a></li><li><a href=#>T-Mobile</a></li><li><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Verizon</a></li><li><a href=#>Sprint</a></li></ul><p>If your phone is eligible, then either request your free device unlock service online or go to a store. Here are the direct links to contact each carrier:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>AT&T: </strong>Submit an Unlock Request on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">AT&T website</a>.</li><li><strong>T-Mobile:</strong> Visit the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">T-Mobile Contact Us</a> page.</li><li><strong>Verizon:</strong> Contact Verizon at *611 from your Verizon Wireless Prepaid phone or call 888-294-6804.</li><li><strong>Sprint:</strong> Visit the <a href=#>Sprint Unlocking FAQs</a> page or call 855-639-4644.</li></ul><p>Remember, the FCC stands in favor of consumers and requires carriers to unlock your phone free of charge so long as the stipulations are met.</p><h3 id=network-unlock-code-10--30>2. Network Unlock Code ($10-$30)</h3><p>You're probably wondering if you can unlock your phone yourself without requiring a call to your carrier or otherwise. Ideally, you should unlock your phone through the carrier. But if you aren't eligible by their terms and still want to unlock your device, you'll need to get it done via a third party.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-of-the-unlock-arena-homepage.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The internet is full of websites that will sell you a network unlock code free of charge. Most sites offering free unlocking for your phone are scams. Most, but not all...</p><p>Depending on the country you are in, the manufacturer of the phone, and the carrier you use, you should expect to pay up to $30. Don't spend any more than that if the seller asks because you will find SIM unlock codes cheaper elsewhere. You can get some unlock codes for as low as $10.</p><p>We checked online reviews and testimonials to find sites that usually work and offer refunds in case the code didn't work. Here are some of the best places to get affordable, reliable phone unlocking codes:</p><ul><li><a href=#>Unlock Radar</a></li><li><a href=#>Release My Code</a></li><li><a href=#>The Unlock Arena</a></li><li><a href=#>Doctor Sim</a></li></ul><p>You can also conduct your own search by typing "how to unlock a phone to any network for free" into Google. Again, we recommend opting for a paid, affordable service to unlock phones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=phone-unlocking-software-for-older-samsung-devices-free>3. Phone Unlocking Software for Older Samsung Devices (Free)</h3><p>If you're using a Samsung Android phone, one desktop software claims to also unlock devices for free. Wondershare's Dr. Fone Toolkit is a paid program for Windows, but you can still use it to get a free list of Samsung unlock codes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-of-wondershare-dr-fone-website-homepage.jpg><p>With the trial version, you can try out the SIM unlocking service for free. You will find it under the More Tools section, and you will need a USB cable to connect your phone to the computer.</p><p>The Dr. Fone Toolkit software is designed to unlock phones to any network. But it's a little old now and might not support all recent Samsung phones. Still, it claims to have a list of Samsung unlock codes that work with more than 400 models across 60 countries. You'll find a complete list of supported devices on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Dr. Fone Tech Specifications page</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And in case you're worried, Dr. Fone has an active customer care service, offers a money-back guarantee, and says the software won't affect your data.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Wondershare Dr. Fone Toolkit for <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Windows</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=it-39-s-better-to-buy-unlocked-phones>It's Better to Buy Unlocked Phones</h2><p>The next time you are buying a phone, take a moment to check if the SIM is locked. The price of a SIM-locked phone is substantially cheaper than an unlocked phone at the outset. But this has hidden costs, such as specific tariffs and plans for that phone and a lock-in period.</p><p>We always recommend buying unlocked phones and saving hundreds of dollars. The flexibility to switch to different mobile plans, as well as the freedom to change SIM cards when you travel, will save you more money than the initial difference between the locked and unlocked handsets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9faHq0tdOeqmasn2KzqrrDZp2rnZViwq%2B4zpyioqaXYrCwsMSsZJ%2BnomK6sK7IpZxmqJiku6a%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeep-found-in-mississippi-river-unoccupied.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jeep found in Mississippi River, unoccupied</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./people-sexiest-man-alive-patrick-dempsey-2023-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hello, People?
