These include:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0"><strong>1. Pay attention to a dog's body language</strong>. Signs of aggression include raised fur, growling, bared teeth, stiff posture, and direct eye contact. If you notice these signs, proceed with caution and give the dog space.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0"><strong>2. Always respect a dog's personal space,</strong> especially if it's unknown to you. Avoid reaching out to pet a dog without permission from the owner, and teach children to do the same.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0"><strong>3. If you encounter a dog you're unfamiliar with, approach slowly and calmly</strong>. Allow the dog to approach you first, and extend a closed hand for them to sniff. Avoid sudden movements or loud noises that may startle the dog.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0"><strong>4. Stay calm and move away slowly.</strong> If a dog appears aggressive or threatening, avoid making direct eye contact or aggressive gestures.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0"><strong>5. Train your dog properly</strong> to reduce the risk of aggressive behaviour. Enrol them in obedience classes and expose them to various environments and people from an early age.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0"><strong>6. Monitor your own dog's behaviour</strong> and intervene if you notice signs of aggression or discomfort. Seek professional help from a veterinarian or animal behaviourist if needed.</p><h5 class="css-xodx9e ebzsujn6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>The best dog-friendly cottages in the UK<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dog-friendly-cottages-3-1616169866.jpg alt="dogfriendly cottages" title="dog friendly cottages" width=770 height=578 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ijuzmo ebzsujn1">1 Woodheads, Lake District</h6><p class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">A magnificent first floor apartment, 1 Woodheads, sits nine miles from Lake Windermere and is part of a Regency-style villa with views out towards Morecambe Bay and the distant Pennines.
