In response to a fan question about whether or not Rascal Flatts will ever reunite, DeMarcus said he hopes so, and underscored how important that era of his career is to him.</p><p>Ideally, he'd like to hold space for Rascal Flatts to reunite, while also pursuing his career at the helm of Red Street Records and performing in his current classic rock supergroup, Generation Radio.</p><p>"The answer is, in a perfect world, they both exist together," DeMarcus muses (quotes via <a href=#>Music Mayhem</a>.) "I've never picked one over the other. I love doing both. Rascal Flatts is my baby with Joe Don [Rooney] and Gary [LeVox], we've built that from the ground up. It'll always be a part of who I am, and I live it. I breathe it."</p><p>However, mounting a Rascal Flatts reunion tour might not be all that simple. All three of the band members would need to be on board, and in the years since their breakup, several statements from the musicians have suggested that Rooney sees the trio's breakup as final. In fall 2021, LeVox revealed in an interview with People&nbsp;that the band's split followed Rooney's decision to quit.</p><p>The conversation happened surrounding Rooney's <a href=#>September 2021 DUI arrest</a>, a misdemeanor offense to which he subsequently pled guilty and served two days in jail.</p><p>"I think God gets your attention in different ways," LeVox commented. "I just wish him the best and I hope he gets everything that he needs to get well and take care of whatever issues he's got going on. There's power in prayer."</p><p>In January 2023, news broke that Rooney and his wife of nearly 17 years, Tiffany Fallon, were <a href=#>divorcing</a>. <a href=#>Court documents</a> surrounding the divorce filings revealed that LeVox and DeMarcus both testified "they would be open to touring as a band if [Rooney] would agree," but Rooney remained committed to keeping the Rascal Flatts breakup final.</p><p>In his Instagram Q&A&nbsp;— which took place shortly before Rooney's divorce news became public&nbsp;— DeMarcus extended well-wishes to his bandmates, though he said that they hadn't been in close contact in recent months.</p><p>"We haven't spoken or stayed in touch a lot, so it has felt like we've been siblings that have sort of been separated by oceans or in other states or across the country," he noted. "There's no bad blood."</p><p>He also suggested that the band's breakup all boiled down to the three artists needing time to pursue separate interests.</p><p>"The bottom line is that I love my brothers in Rascal Flatts and I want nothing but the best for them," he stated.</p><p>"... Everybody does need a little time away," DeMarcus summed up. "And I think that if the good Lord willing, we should get back together someday, and we'll have a greater appreciation for it, maybe more than we ever did. So, that would be my hope and my prayer."</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>16 Shocking Country Celebrity Breakups</h2><p><strong>These Heartwrenching Breakup Songs Hurt, Too</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5mpYrGmucCrmq6rXaeutK%2FApWSfpJGpwbR50Z6sp6Gfo3w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./longtime-portland-music-promoter-mike-thrasher-passes-at-48.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Longtime Portland Music Promoter Mike Thrasher Passes At 48</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hallmarks-alison-sweeney-shares-carrot-cake-recipe-for-movie.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hallmark's Alison Sweeney Shares Carrot Cake Recipe for Movie</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
