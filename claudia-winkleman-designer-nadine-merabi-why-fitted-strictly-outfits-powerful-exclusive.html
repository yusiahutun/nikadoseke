Every weekend while gracing our TV screens, the 51-year-old star always manages to flaw us with her glitzy and beautifully tailored ensembles.&nbsp;</p><p id=eFOBhwQmvl data-wc=28>Impressing week after week with a wardrobe many would dream of having, it seems there's one trusty fashion designer <a class=hm-link href=#>Claudia tends to gravitate towards</a>, and that's Nadine Merabi.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3c3ffdb3edee-455806.jpg><p id=egCWPePz9M data-wc=51>Having been in the industry for the past seven years, the fashion designer has amassed an army of fans and has credited Claudia's primetime appearance for sending the brand alight. It's no secret that MERABI thrives online, recently leaping into the physical domain by opening its first retail pop-up in London.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUa5B-ioI9 data-wc=27>Speaking at the launch, British-Lebanese designer Nadine opened up about the impact having stars such as Claudia and Strictly&nbsp;judge <a class=hm-link href=#>Motsi Mabuse</a> has had on her empire.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eSrTGXHNeC data-wc=55>"It's just a little bit surreal but also a lot of people think, 'Oh my goodness, you've just gone huge overnight' But it's not the case as I started designing 12 years ago and it's been a lot of hard work," she explained. "I finally feel like I'm getting to showcase my designs to people."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b964b22e2a86-claduia-winkleman-strictly.jpg><p id=ej9ipkhvaU data-wc=63>She continued: "With Claudia and Motsi wearing my pieces, I think it's really cool. It's prime-time TV, there are so many families watching the show together. It does bring families together on a Saturday night. It's great knowing that because I get messages from my friends, mums and their daughters. It just shows that such a wide range of people are watching it.&nbsp;</p><p id=eXxCnbISH6 data-wc=29>"Especially having someone like Claudia in my designs is wonderful, she's so relatable and not intimidating in the slightest. So yes, it's really nice to see our designs TV."&nbsp;</p><p id=e8AlEVNn66 data-wc=38>On how her pieces have been designed to make "women feel more confident," Nadine revealed: "Each collection I design, each one - I think - gets kind of a little bit more experimental and a bit more confident.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMkPve_rcz data-wc=29>"I think it's just me growing within, with my own confidence in designing. I'm very conscious of the female body shape and the desire to making us feel amazing."&nbsp;</p><p id=eFm7OHi3u5 data-wc=36>She added: "At the end of the day, if someone puts something on and they feel amazing, then they're going to walk with a different kind of confidence and air of confidence about them will change."&nbsp;</p><p id=e1AbZhtylC data-wc=18>But what's Nadine's powerful secret down to? "Silhouettes and fits are really, really important to me," she shared.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/75e0fb88f375-sofia-vergara-red-carpet-2.jpg><p id=ebTwYsIRFY data-wc=29>In recent years, the premium pieces have been spotted on US reality show&nbsp;Selling Sunset&nbsp;and on <a class=hm-link href=#>stars such as Sofia Vergara</a>, Miley Cyrus and her mum Tish Cyrus.&nbsp;</p><p id=exv2MPMTWlx data-wc=87>Nadine also tends to bring back her most popular styles, sometimes with minor adjustments and colour changes. "That was also a bit of a conscious effort, I think I've always been the same in the sense of if I like to keep something, I want to be able to wear it over and over until it's unwearable. With all my designs, I want it to be so you can keep it in your wardrobe, wear it again and make you feel amazing each time you wear it."&nbsp;</p><p id=eMhGUu2rdU data-wc=42>Asked why she has opened MERABI's very first store, the designer commented: "Some people might be a bit scared about ordering something online without trying something on. They might think they're too old or they might think they're not the right size.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c2d5ea489551-nadine-merabi-pop-up-8.jpg><p id=eCv3fFB8m6N data-wc=31>"I'm trying to show that we are more accessible and relatable. We just want to help people experiment and feel their best and add a bit of sparkle wherever they go."&nbsp;</p><p id=esoIivB7ab data-wc=42>She added: "I feel like a lot of our clothing has taken me so long to create. Trying to develop the fabrics, get the fit right, get the patterns right and get the completed design - that sometimes can take 12 months.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4a8409b219e9-nadine-merabi-pop-up-24.jpg><p id=eT5tmUzunP data-wc=40>"And then if it's just some online imagery, you don't get to feel the crater shape the work that's gone into it. So for me, it's for people to be able to see the product in person which is incredible."&nbsp;</p><p id=eKpdXhv9Wb data-wc=14>The store, 42 South Molton Street, will be open to the public through mid-January.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm660tMiopWhtYG5%2BeHyOnKOarZSerm7DyKeipZ2dlrtusMSsoKCmlad6r63DoqWeZZ2av6KuyGauobFdm7a1wMSdZKysop6wtbjYZqaurJaewbR5z6iunqqWqrlusdeco66rmauycA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./florida-rodeo-queen-dies-injuries-competition-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Florida rodeo queen Lara Dewees dies after accident during barrel racing competition</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tracee-ellis-ross-fans-in-tears-upsetting-news-black-ish-final-season.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Black-ish star Tracee Ellis Ross brings fans to tears with show update</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
