He is loyal to Wessex, and to both King Alfred (David Dawson) in his time and to Alfred‚Äôs son, King Edward (Timothy Innes). He‚Äôs a fan-favorite character that fans truly appreciate.</p><p id=par-4_51>On July 23, 2021, Clerkin shared some images of himself on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;dressed as Father Pyrlig. In the first image, he stands with his hands behind his back as he wears Pyrlig‚Äôs robes, belt, and cross necklace. He looks rather serious in the image shared while standing in front of a stone wall.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_47>Next is a shot of Clerkin dressed as Pyrlig getting a makeup touch-up done while outside as he looks at the camera. The final shot is Clerkin as Pyrlig in his robes while wearing his necklace as he stands facing the camera in front of wooden logs.</p><p id=par-6_19>Clerkin captioned the post: ‚Äú#fatherpyrlig #thelastkingdom #season4.‚Äù He also credits James Northcote, who plays Aldhelm, with taking the photos.</p><h2 id=h-cavan-clerkin-recently-shared-some-behind-the-scenes-content-fans-will-want-to-see>Cavan Clerkin recently shared some behind-the-scenes content fans will want to see</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-7_53>Clerkin recently shared some other images on&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;on July 2, 2021, also from season 4. In the first black and white photo, Clerkin is again dressed as his character with what looks like a sword leaning on his head as he lays down in the grass on his side. He smiles for the shot.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_31>There is also another black and white photo of Pyrlig lying back on what looks like a horse. In another black and white photo, Pyrlig smiles as he holds an umbrella.</p><p id=par-9_46>There‚Äôs yet another black and white image of Clerkin as Pyrlig on what looks like a battlefield. Nearby are other characters, including Mark Rowley as Finan, Timothy Innes as King Edward, Finn Elliot as Uhtred‚Äôs son, Young Uhtred, and what looks like Ewan Mitchell as Osferth.</p><h2 id=h-cavan-clerkin-also-shared-a-video>Cavan Clerkin also shared a video</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_87>There‚Äôs even a black and white video of Clerkin holding a dummy without a head in front of him. He says something in the video with no sound, then his hat is gone, and he waves the dummy‚Äôs hand and arm and laughs. Next, we see Clerkin alongside what could be Millie Brady, who plays Aethelflaed, dressed in character. They both hold a dummy without a head and move around while waving with one of their hands. Clerkin eventually puts his hand down before the video concludes.</p><p id=par-11_26>Clerkin captioned the post: ‚Äú#fatherpyrlig #thelastkingdom #season4.‚Äù He gives credit to James Northcote as the photographer again. He also adds, ‚Äú(No animals or children were harmed&nbsp;üòÇ).‚Äù</p><p id=par-12_17>It‚Äôs always great to see content like this of our favorite characters and actors from&nbsp;<a href=#>The Last Kingdom</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMpZisrF2gtq%2Bzw6ikZpuRq66vecKlnKujmaN6tLTAq5ydZZmirqix0mafoqWjmrmnecOrnKyrlZl6p63ToZyrZaCuv621xmefraWcZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kalani-hilliker-wiki-boyfriend-dating-affair-family-ethnicity-net-worth-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kalani Hilliker Wiki, Boyfriend, Dating, Affair, Family, Ethnicity and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./9-facts-about-umbria-jazz-festival.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>9 Facts About Umbria Jazz Festival</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
