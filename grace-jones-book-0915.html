Now 67, the model, musician, actress, and Studio 54 icon has pushed boundaries at every turn, inspiring fellow artists like Keith Haring, Andy Warhol, and her longtime boyfriend, Jean-Paul Goude. Here, an exclusive excerpt from her forthcoming autobiography, I'll Never Write My Memoirs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>MY FIRST ORGASM</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shaving my head led directly to my first orgasm. This is because I am fairly sure that the man I had my first orgasm with was Andre, my hairdresser from Cinandre, a huge salon at 57th Street and Madison Avenue. It was such a revelation, almost traumatic, the very first, that most of the details have been wiped away, other than the tidal rush of feelings, but a little bit of detective work, rummaging through my memories, has led to Andre as the prime suspect. His salon was where I was sent to make sure that when my hair started to grow back I didn't go ahead and shave it off again. …</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These days they say DJs are God. Back then it was hairdressers who were God. Like Vidal Sassoon. All the celebrities would go to hairstylists like Andre. He was more than a hairdresser. He was an artist and a photographer, very experimental. He cut the hair of lots of models and actresses, and he invented the Farrah Fawcett flick. It was decided he would know what to do with me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He definitely knew what to do with me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Andre relished this instinct that I had to find a different place to be, even when it came to my hair, and he treated my short hair like a canvas. It was very short, but there were ways he could change how it looked, and instinctively this was what I was after, constant change. It would be a key part of my overall performance. My hair could be adjusted, changed, edited, in much the same way that later my whole body would be treated. …</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I suppose it's not surprising that my first orgasm was with Andre. His fingers on my scalp working their magic helped, and it didn't take much for that to lead to great sex. I'd never had sex like that before. It was sex from another era, another solar system. It still started with the mouth but it ended up beyond the body. It made me feel like I was falling backward in time. He was very open-minded and creative, and that seemed to spill over into the sex. He bent me out of shape.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>JERRY HALL AND ME</strong></p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span><p>Jones with Jerry Hall, Paris, 1975, photographed by Antonio Lopez</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Their first three girls at Euro Planning [modeling agency in Paris] were me, Jerry Hall, and Jessica Lange.… [We] would basically use our minuscule rooms in the hotel to sleep, and for little else, and we would be out every night—clubs, music, fashion, life. Paris seemed to stay out at night even later than New York. We'd drag ourselves back to the room in daylight after a night out and get ready for the next.… I developed incredible, long-lasting bonds with the girls I worked with, not least because I also lived with them and we explored new, strange territory together. I have remained friends with Jerry and Jessica to this day, and we help each other and inspire each other.…</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All dinners in Paris, I noted, would end with intense discussions about sex. What else was there? A good dinner, fabulous wine, and then talk about sex, and the world is a better place.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jerry was very open about sex. In Texas, for some reason, the women are very different from those in the reserved American North. Texan women love talking about having sex in the barn—head outside, body inside, so that the rain would be falling on their face while down below they were being ravished in the dry, head soaked wet, the bottom half getting it on in the hay.…</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jerry and I would compete for boys. We had this kind of competition going. Our personalities fitted together, but we were also opposites. We liked the same things, and we especially liked the same boys, so we fought sometimes to be first to get there. She would get very jealous. She would ask about a boy we would both be chasing, her eyes flashing, where were you last night—did you get him?! Yes, I did, I would admit. Goddammit, I wanted him, she'd drawl, genuinely a little put out. It was sibling rivalry.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>JACK NICHOLSON AND THE MODELS</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Michael Douglas and Jack Nicholson came to see [us in] Issey [Miyake]'s show. They were in Japan promoting One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Of course, they took us out after one of the shows. Jack ordered a couple of limos. Jack, Michael, and all the models—it was very crazy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A couple of the models were a little too starstruck, throwing themselves at Jack. And he was manipulating the situation. There was that Barry White bass in the background. He would sit there with his arms outstretched and big come-on grin, being Jack even then. Before I knew it, girls started to disappear one by one. I found out the next day from my roommate, an African princess who spoke only French, that he was inviting each girl to meet in the car, and each girl thought she was the only one. And one by one they turned up.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I caught his eye and I could tell what he was up to. I wagged my finger. No, Jack. No way. I am wired to leave when it is heading that way. It did not seem interesting to me. I was not going to go with a bunch of girls losing the plot. I went home. I had a big word with them the next day! Much later on, many years later, I met Jack and quietly found out for myself what he was like. Actually, we mostly talked about hats, and who had the better collection.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To this day, when the celebrities turn up—Bette, Stevie Wonder, Elton John—I have to warn my band, Do not let this freak you out. You get distracted. Even the queen was not going to distract me.</p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span><p>Meeting Queen Elizabeth II, 2012</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>MY BABY SHOWER, HOSTED BY DEBBIE HARRY</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I had my baby shower at the Garage when I was pregnant with Paulo [Goude]. Debbie Harry of Blondie and Andy Warhol threw it for me. That's showing you normal. (Paulo and Keith Haring would also become very close; to Paulo, he was Uncle Keith. They would draw together, like it was the most fun you could have in the world.) The papers called it the first disco baby shower, and Paulo was being talked about as "the first disco baby." I did an interview with a magazine, Jet: "I want a boy—family tradition, boys first. It should be surrounded by music." The magazine said I was hoping for natural childbirth and breast-feeding, "if I don't chicken out first." I was dressed up as a deviant toy soldier, carried onto the stage by my troops on a pedestal, with the audience of lusty Garage boys screaming, "Show us the stomach, honey." I then sang "Get Down on Your Knees." The Garage was the kind of place where this kind of drama could happen—a world unto itself embedded in but separate from the surrounding city, where the party was more important than business, and the vibe reached higher than the skyscrapers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong>ROBBED AT GUNPOINT WITH JEAN-PAUL GOUDE</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was living on 54th Street, and Jean-Paul lived on the top floor of a commercial building on Union Square, some 40 blocks south. We were together but maintaining our independence.… One weekend I was staying with him. His 16th Street penthouse apartment opened out onto a terrace—you can see it in the video for "Libertango," where all of New York becomes the backdrop.…</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was one of those ordinary mornings—well, probably early afternoon, because it was the weekend. I was walking from the bathroom. This tall black guy suddenly appeared out of nowhere on the terrace, quiet as a panther. He was wearing a beautiful Italian-style suit and had the most perfectly shaped Afro. He didn't look like a New Yorker. He had a bag slung over his shoulder, very casual. My eyes scanned him very quickly. I said, a little shocked, but there seemed nothing else to say, "Hello, can I help you?" Then I noticed that he was holding a gun. A very small gun, which somehow made it even more threatening.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Butterflies tore through my stomach. I could see through to the far end of the apartment where Jean-Paul was working hunched over his desk, wearing glasses, cutting up small pictures of me into small pieces and moving them around. He was totally oblivious, concentrating on solving some puzzle about how I might be turned into a new shape. I ran to the bathroom and closed the door. The tall guy followed me and kicked down the bathroom door. He thought I was running and getting a gun, so he was on high alert. There was fear in his eyes. I was on the floor quietly freaking out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This was when it became serious and Jean-Paul heard the commotion. He came to see what was going on. He saw the surreal glint of the small gun.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The guy wanted cash, and Jean-Paul only had deutsche marks. The guy didn't know what they were, that they were at that time the strongest currency in the world. Jean-Paul was offering him camera equipment. He didn't want to carry that. He really just wanted cash.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jean-Paul's work was always scattered over the floor. He never hung anything up. … The guy recognized me from the photos. I had done a talk show the week before. "Didn't I see you on The Merv Griffin Show last week?" he asked, a little softer than he was before, intrigued that I might be someone.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=61 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I thought, "Oh no, now I really am dead. There's no one in the building, and now he has recognized me: I am dead." I became oddly calm. He tied us both up. Jean-Paul started giggling from nerves, like he was in a movie. There was a small mirror next to the bed to make the room look bigger, nothing kinky, and he was being tied up on the bed and seeing it happen, and he laughed. I was thinking, "Please don't do that—here we are, a mixed couple, and you are laughing at him. There's a black guy in the house with a perfect Afro and a gun and you are giggling."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I hissed at him, "Stop it, this is serious," giving him a really stern expression. I started to use my mother's technique and tried to charm the guy and get a grip on the situation. "Yeah, I was on Merv Griffin."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=65 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Oh, yeah, you're that girl?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=67 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I got us to chatting so that it was almost as if we were having a cup of coffee. I said, "You can change that money at any Thomas Cook agency; you don't need ID." There were about 2,000 deutsche marks, so he was going to get a lot of dollars.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=69 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He could have easily killed us, and no one would have found us until Monday. We started to communicate. He eventually said okay. The elevator door opened into the loft. He untied me but not Jean-Paul. I told him where to go to change the marks. I gave him our keys so he could get out, because you needed to open the lock to make the lift work. I said, "Leave the keys on the fourth floor, and we will give you time to get away."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=71 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After he had gone, Jean-Paul asked me to untie him. I said, "I can't, I promised him that I wouldn't untie you for a certain amount of time," like he was still watching us somehow. It was like an episode of Kojak, "Die Before They Wake." After about 20 minutes, I untied Jean-Paul, much to his anger and relief.</p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=75 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I'll Never Write My Memoirs, by Grace Jones and Paul Morley, will be published by Gallery Books in September and is available for pre-order at <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1476765073 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=amazon.com data-vars-ga-product-id=67cd3c28-d8b4-47d3-a875-a7c63a28bbe8 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1476765073 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1476765073 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1476765073 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="Gallery Books" data-vars-ga-product-price=$29.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=7dc04344-ada2-4aa0-840c-7b2731882dc2 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Gallery Books" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Actors & Entertainers" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">amazon.com</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGiZoql6o7vOpKpmpaWotqR7wGpocGxkZLSzrcKeZKOnnprAbq7OqKJmaGlmgnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./477996-100-fire-instagram-captions-guys-savage-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>100+ fire Instagram captions for guys for your savage photos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-bettes-married-wife-gay-children-salary-net-worth-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mike Bettes Married, Wife, Gay, Children, Salary, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
