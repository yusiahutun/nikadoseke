But now it’s December and, at times, I know it can feel like we will need a jeweler’s loupe to find some of this promised festivity. There are essays about what a bummer this holiday season promises to be. There are articles about what a dark winter is ahead. There are dire warnings about overwhelmed health systems. Listen, I am in charge of absolutely nothing — not even my own children listen to me — but I hereby give us permission to read none of these articles. Real life can be enough of a drag; we have absolutely no moral imperative to absorb additional gloom.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2560 height=1707 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sour-cream-and-chive-fantails-scaled.jpg alt decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> It would not be the Smitten Kitchen if I wasn’t popping in here, chaotic as ever, 24 hours before the cooking- and eating-est day of most of our years, to suggest a new recipe for your menus, that, judging by my DMs, you settled weeks ago. Good news, however, there’s no timestamp on dinner rolls, especially ones as wonderful as these. If anything, I don’t think we eat them often enough — you know, just because it’s Wednesday.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2560 height=1707 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/corn-pudding-brown-butter-scaled.jpg alt decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> In other years, the ones when it was safe to have guests, my favorite thing to ask when planning a Thanksgiving menu was for everyone to tell me what their essential dish is, the one if they come to dinner and it’s not on the table, they throw a (hopefully) muted, inner tantrum. This is where all menus should begin, right? It was from this question that I learned that after <a href=#>stuffing</a>, naturally, and long before <a href=#>turkey</a> (sorry, turkey), a dish I had not grown up with — corn pudding — is one of the most popular on American Thanksgiving tables. Because I usually respond, “Great! Now you know exactly what to bring!” and friends have delivered, I’ve since learned what I’d been missing and I’m now fully converted.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2560 height=1707 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/potato-and-leek-gratin-scaled.jpg alt="potato and leek gratin" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Because I do not often crave potatoes slow-baked in a cream bath with a burnish of cheese and fine crunch top, when I do, I know exactly how I want it to taste and how much work I’m willing to do to make it happen. Since it’s been eleven years (!) since I last shared a <a href=#>potato gratin</a> here, I think it’s worth revisiting as we head into gratin season, which is not a thing, I absolutely just made that up, but really should be for colder weather and shorter days.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2560 height=1707 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-10-29-21.27.08-2-scaled.jpg alt="bialy babka" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Completely randomly — an idea just fluttered down like a November leaf and landed on this patch of calendar, the day before the day in which all of the time we do not spend on a line to vote we will instead spend glued to election returns and trying not to bite our nails down to the nub — I’ve been thinking about the kind of cooking we do when tensions are high and a little distraction might be the height of self-care. May I recommend some extended time in the kitchen? Stirring a pot, kneading a dough, and reading a recipe forces us to briefly pause our scrolling and invest in something tangible, like a cozy meal. <a href=#>Lasagna with fresh pasta sheets</a>! <a href=#>Peerless chicken noodle soup</a>. <a href=#>A really luxurious Caesar salad</a>. <a href=#>Pot pies</a>. <a href=#>Wildly decadent macaroni-and-cheese</a>. <a href=#>Falafel, from scratch</a>. <a href=#>The highest calling of tomato soup and grilled cheese</a>.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2560 height=1707 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/morning-glory-breakfast-cake-scaled.jpg alt decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> It’s hardly the biggest surprise of parenting, but I’ve yet to get my head around the idea that I’ve taken part in creating a morning person. My son has always woken up early; if it’s 5/5:30am, he’s on the sofa, reading a thick book, wondering why we do not care to watch the sunrise with him. Over the years, we’ve tried everything to change his wiring — lecturing, star charts, bribery, begging, asking the pediatrician to talk some sense into him [although “he wakes up early and reads chapter books!” didn’t quite have the doom-and-gloom impact we’d thought it would], prayer — and eventually, as you might have inferred from referring to it as wiring, we gave up.<p><a title="what you'll need" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50532425688_6a7bb5c681_z.jpg alt="what you'll need" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>When you wake up at the crack of dawn, you also require breakfast at an earlier hour than normal people, like your parents, who love to sleep. So there’s no, uh, confusion as to what is and is not a “breakfast food,” we’ve taken to packing him a breakfast and leaving it in the fridge: a <a href=#>hard-boiled egg</a>, fruit, cheese, and some sort of muffin. After working my way through my own <a href=#>muffin archives</a>, I realized that I was missing one of those hippie/morning glory-ish muffins that he loves, loaded with carrots and apple and dried fruit, sometimes coconut, and spices. I’ve made a few versions over the last few months, and was about to go another round when a new (out tomororw), wonderful cookbook arrived at my doorstep: <a href=#>Yossy Arefi’s Snacking Cakes</a>.</p><p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2560 height=1707 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/skillet-turkey-chili-scaled.jpg alt decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Right around the time <a href=#>quarantine cookies</a> and <a href=#>tacos</a> became a habit this spring, I also realized that that none of my existing chili recipes exactly fit the bill of what I wanted for dinner — namely, to focus on ground turkey, have a minimized ingredient list, and not take terribly long because it turns out that even with all day, every day at home, I just don’t have enough time to plan ahead for dinner and please don’t try to use reason or psychology to suggest there are <a href=#>other forces at play</a>, okay?<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2560 height=1707 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/simple-cauliflower-tacos-scaled.jpg alt decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Last week I told you about our favorite <a href=#>quarantine cookies</a>. This is our quarantine taco, another simple discovery from our early Inside Days this spring that ticked a miraculous number of boxes at once. Like, “How do we turn this massive head of cauliflower into dinner because it’s too big for our overstuffed fridge?” and “without having to go to the store and buy anything extra?” It used so many ingredients that had become <a href=#>staples</a> — canned beans, cotija (great fridge shelf life), red onions, tortillas, and a small luxury of an <a href=#>avocado delivery</a> service we discovered right when we needed it most. Plus, it managed to work for the whole family, including our pickiest, who we discovered liked roasted cauliflower and also pickled onions, we suspect because they’re pink.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2560 height=1707 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/whole-wheat-chocolate-oat-cookies-scaled.jpg alt decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Because I am happiest when I let cakes be cakes, and cookies be cookies in all of their real-butter-and-refined sugar bliss, I rarely swap whole wheat or other ingredients in desserts in an effort to put a health halo on them, with two exceptions. The first is morning baked goods, usually muffins <a href=#>like</a> <a href=#>these</a> I’d make for the kids on a weekday, which just feel more breakfast when they least resemble, say, a birthday cake, not that there aren’t days that require that, too. The second is when I think the baked good is improved by the ingredient swap — more crisp/craggy, dynamic or flavorful. I just never expected it to happen to what we call our <a href=#>House Cookie</a> — a one-bowl oatmeal cookie I’ve probably made many times a year for well over a decade, always putting extra scoops in the freezer, so we can have freshly baked cookies when life demands them.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2560 height=1707 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/homemade-cream-cheese-b-scaled.jpg alt decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> A few years ago, I figured out how to make cream cheese and didn’t quite know what to do with this information. What kind of crazy person makes their own cream cheese, no matter how delicious it is? Then again, you could use that reasoning to reject almost anything here (looking in particular at you, <a href=#>marshmallows</a>) and you’re still here. But I suspected this would be a bridge too far. Even food blogging grandmothers have to stay relevant and who has looked around [gestures to all of these things in this world right now] and said “What really keeps me up at night is the stabilizers in store-bought cream cheese”?<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirnZ7BtbHNpKCtm5iau2%2BvzqZmqZmXmnxyfI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./442247-what-a-guy-initiates-a-hug-5-know.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What does it mean when a guy initiates a hug? 5 things you should know</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-allio.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Allio Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
