The most straightforward option that doesn't involve wiping any data is to create a bootable microSD card with the <a href=#>Windows To Go</a> version of the operating system, allowing you to use both Windows and SteamOS on your Deck.</p><p>You can also install Windows directly on <a href=#>your Steam Deck's internal SSD</a>, wiping SteamOS off your device in the process. We don't recommend doing this if all you want is to experiment with Windows on your Deck.&nbsp;<a href=#>Going back to SteamOS</a> can be a chore since you'll have to create a bootable drive and reinstall the OS. And if you don't have a backup you'll also have to go through the setup process again, which includes installing games and apps, setting up emulators, importing non-Steam games, etc.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To DCPromo in Windows Server 2012?</a></span></p><p>There's also the option of installing Windows on an external SSD, which would be a great option if it weren't for the fact that the Deck features a single USB-C port, meaning you'll have to disconnect the SSD every time your Deck needs a charge.</p><p>If you want to pursue that route anyway, one solution for the issue is to get a USB-C <a href=#>dock</a> and only use Windows when you're connected to the said dock, allowing you to use Windows even while your Deck is charging.</p><p>Finally, you could dual-boot Windows and SteamOS on the Deck's internal drive. While SteamOS technically <a href=# rel=noopener>supports dual boot with Windows</a>, the procedure for making that happen is rather complex and long-winded. Also, there's always the chance for a new SteamOS update to break dual boot functionality, <a href=# rel=noopener>which has already happened</a> before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We recommend using the SD card method if you want to taste the flavor of Windows on Steam Deck. If you find the Windows experience usable or even better than the SteamOS one, you can install Windows on the internal SSD or an external one if you own a dock. We'll guide you through both of those methods in this guide.</p><h2 id=run-windows-on-steam-deck-with-an-sd-card-what-you-need>Run Windows on Steam Deck With an SD Card: What You Need</h2><p>To install Windows on your Steam Deck using a <a href=# rel=noopener>microSD card</a>, you'll need a Windows ISO file along with a microSD card, a card reader (or <a href=#>a USB-C dock</a> with one), and a copy of <a href=#>Rufus</a>.</p><p>Regarding the microSD card, we recommend using at least a 64GB UHS-I card that supports <a href=# rel=noopener>A2/U3</a> speeds. Those are faster than the A1/U1 card we used and will make the whole Windows experience snappier and more fluid.</p><p>A solid pick is the <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">128GB SAMSUNG PRO Plus</a>, a UHS-I microSD card that supports A2/U3 speeds. It sports a competitive price and is also available in 256GB and 512GB sizes. If you're looking for a 64GB option check out the <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">SanDisk 64GB Extreme microSDXC</a>, another quality choice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/41qjvqfdezl-_sl160_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>SAMSUNG PRO Plus 128GB microSDXC</h5><p class=display-card-description></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$31 at Amazon</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Samsung</a><p>We also recommend using a USB-C dock, a <a href=#>keyboard</a>, and a <a href=#>mouse</a> to make the Windows setup process as painless as possible. The good news is that you can use wireless keyboards and mice as long as they come with a 2.4GHz wireless dongle. Just place the dongle in one of the USB slots on the dock, and you're good to go.</p><p>The dock should have at least a couple of USB-A ports and an HDMI port. If you can get one that has a microSD card slot, that will save you from having to buy a separate SD card reader.</p><p>Eventually, you'll also need to download the <a href=# rel=noopener>Steam Deck Windows drivers</a>, download links for which you can find below.
