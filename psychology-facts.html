It entails how your brain tends to find a face where there is none rather than missing a real one.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-25>You always find a problem.</h2><p><span>It is psychologically normal for you to find another problem upon resolving one.

It explains why you undermine a loved one’s wrongdoings despite how bad it is.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-27>High expectations incline people to rise to it while low ones have no such effects.</h2><p><span>The Pygmalion effect holds the explanation as to why you do better when other people believe you would. On the contrary, you could not do well when someone expects you to fail.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-28>Crying has benefits.</h2><p><span><img alt="crying has benefits, psychology facts" width=1920 height=1267 sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/benefits-of-crying.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><span>Doing so could make you feel a lot better, reduce stress, and could even help in keeping your body healthy.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-29>It is possible to feel certain about something without facts or reasoning.</h2><p><span>Undergoing electric simulation over that specific part of your brain could trigger a feeling of certainty despite the absence of evidence or logic.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-30>Some people are afraid of feeling too much happiness.</h2><p><span>It is due to the fear of the pattern that something tragic might happen next.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-31>There is a reason why that song is your favorite.</h2><p><span>It is not just about the lyrics or the tune, it is because you link that song with an emotional event in your life.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-32>Smart people tend to depreciate themselves.</h2><p><span>On the other hand, ignorant people think they are excellent. This psychology fact would make you take a second look at the people that you know and how they present themselves.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-33>The pain from being ignored is not an overreaction.</h2><p><span>This feeling has similar chemical effects as to that of a physical injury. Hence, your brain handles rejection like it would with physical pain.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-34>Being lonely is worse for your health than you actually think.</h2><p><span>A Harvard University study found a connection between extreme loneliness and the very same levels of the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>blood</a>-clotting protein responsible for stroke and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>heart</a> attacks.</span></p><p><span>In other words, not having friends could have the same deadly effect as smoking.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-35>Psychology facts proved that power lessens a person’s care for others.</h2><p><span>Aside from the Stanford Prison Experiment, other studies found that people who are in the position of power become worse at assessing another’s feelings. It shows in their lack of facial expression which is a major indicator of loss of empathy.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-36>Receiving rewards could convince you that a boring task was fun.</h2><p><span><img alt="reward system, ice cream, psychology facts" width=750 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ice-cream-reward.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><span>A study paid volunteers to convince someone that a boring task was actually interesting.

The brain makes you prioritize urgent tasks, regardless of its importance, because it knows that you could complete them.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-38>Optimism could be taught.</h2><p><span>What’s more, is that researchers also observed that you could teach it to yourself.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-39>Psychologically speaking, there is more behind an internet troll.</h2><p><span>Scientists claim that most of them are naturally psychopathic, narcissistic and sadistic.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-40>What considered normal anxiety levels has increased over the years.</h2><p><span>The average 1950s psychiatric patients demonstrated the same level of anxiety that could be found in today’s average high school kid.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-41>People aged between 18 and 33 carry the most amount of stress in the world.</h2><p><span>The stress levels only tend to reduce after the border age of 33.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-42>France is the most depressed country in the world.</h2><p><span>For every 5 people, 1 suffers from depression.
