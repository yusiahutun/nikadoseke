Individual differences are one of those interesting facets of humans. Many Psychologists and researchers have attributed Intelligence as one of the many factors that contribute to the differences among individuals.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>Theories of Intelligence in Psychology</a></strong></p><p>There have always been estimations and statistics in knowing the high IQ people in the world from Albert Einstein to Leonardo Da Vinci to Stephen Hawking; the curiosity and enthusiasm to learn and understand them has recently increased. There have been theories and conceptualizations made by many theorists and researchers around the world. Before we get to learn about the theories, we will understand firsthand the meaning of Intelligence.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>What is Intelligence?</h4><p>Intelligence is the capacity to uncover opportunities in every challenge and paint the canvas of life with strokes of innovation and abilities. According to the Oxford Learner Dictionary, Intelligence is the ability to learn, understand, and think logically about things; the ability to do this well. There are so many definitions of Intelligence. Of all, the one that is accepted globally is Weschler’s definition of Intelligence:</p><p>“Aggregate global capacity of an individual to think rationally, act purposefully, and deal effectively with the environment”.</p><p>To be able to understand Intelligence in a better way, we have many theories proposed by different researchers. A theory includes a formal set of ideas that is proposed to explain why something happens or exists.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Theories of Intelligence</h4><p>There are so many theories of Intelligence which include:</p><ul><li>Spearman’s two-factor theory</li><li>Thurstone’s Theory of Intelligence</li><li>Guilford’s intellect theory</li><li>Cattell’s theory</li><li><a href=#>Gardner’s theory of multiple Intelligence</a></li><li>Sternberg’s Triarchic Theory of Intelligence</li><li>PASS Theory of Intelligence</li><li>Cross-cultural conceptions</li></ul><p>Among the other theories of Intelligence is a theory proposed by Robert Jeffery Sternberg, an American Psychologist. We will discuss the various aspects of Sternberg’s theory of Intelligence in detail. Robert Jeffery Sternberg, a psychologist from Yale University, was born on December 8, 1949. He’s well-known for helping us understand intelligence better. He came up with the Triarchic Theory of Intelligence. According to him, intelligence is the ability to learn from experience, think well, remember important things, and handle everyday life. His ideas have helped us see intelligence more completely.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>5 Most Famous Psychologists &nbsp;</a></strong></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Triarchic Theory of Intelligence</h4><p>This theory stipulates that Intelligence is composed of three distinct and interrelated aspects which is why it is called a Triarchic theory. The three aspects include</p><ul><li>Componential or analytical Intelligence – book smart</li><li>Experiential or Creative Intelligence</li><li>Contextual or Practical Intelligence – street smart</li></ul><li><strong>Componential or Analytical Intelligence</strong> refers to the analysis of information to solve problems. It could be emphasized as the ability to break down the problem into components and analyse things for problem-solving. It is more of a traditional approach that relates to academic achievement. It is also called book smart. Example: Solving a complex mathematical problem- a student facing a problem in a mathematical problem, instead of solving it immediately, breaks it into smaller parts, identifies patterns, and applies a systematic approach, this way or approach is because of Analytical intelligence. Analytical intelligence has three components:</li><ul><li><strong>Meta-component-</strong> the executive part that controls cognitive processing and performance</li><li><strong>Performance component- </strong>the one that involves performing a task or an activity</li><li><strong>Knowledge component-</strong> the one meant for the Acquisition of knowledge and ways used to acquire them</li></ul><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>What is Social Intelligence?</a></strong></p><li><strong>Experiential or Creative Intelligence </strong>refers to the one that involves using past experiences creatively to solve novel or unique problems. This involves engaging in divergent thinking- creatively solving problems. Example: Creating a piece of art- X, when faced with unique problems on woodwork, relies on her years of hands-on experience, and navigates optimal approach and craft without instructions. This is what we call Creative Intelligence. Experiential Intelligence has two components:</li><ul><li><strong>Automation-</strong> the one that requires not much attention, effort, or energy. This information processing is something that flows automatically.</li><li><strong>Novelty-</strong> unique or new processing which is much parallel to Automation. This involves coming up with new and novel ideas.</li></ul><li><strong>Contextual or Practical Intelligence</strong> refers to the intelligence that is intertwined with the individual’s environment. The ability to adapt to one’s environment, and shape the environment to the best fit of individual. This one involves the capability of an individual to use his or her ability to function efficiently in life. This one is called street smart. Example: Successfully managing a team- During arguments, Mr. M uses his Contextual or practical skills of communication style, and adjusting them with the cultural norm has gained her international clients concerning her business. The components of Contextual Intelligence include:</li><ul><li><strong>Adaptation-</strong> making adjustments to the new environment</li><li><strong>Shaping –</strong> shaping one’s environment according to the needs and requirements</li><li><strong>Selection – </strong>completely change one’s older environment with the new effective one</li></ul><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>What is Emotional Intelligence?</a></strong></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Why Triarchic Theory of Intelligence?</h4><p>While most theories of intelligence focus on Intelligence upon just one aspect, the Triarchic theory measures or makes understanding based on componential (knowledge or ability), contextual (practical or situation-based), and creative aspects of an individual. This approach gave almost all the aspects of Intelligence and provided the most comprehensive approach to Intelligence.</p><p>Critical Implications of Triarchic Theory</p><ul><li>The theory lacks operational definition- lacks universal definitions.</li><li>Lacks empirical shreds of evidence that support the triarchic components.</li><li>The simple nature of the theory oversimplifies the aspects of intelligence.</li><li>The theory lacks emphasis on potential cultural bias.</li></ul><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>15 Women psychologists Who made their contribution to the field</a></strong></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Applications of Triarchic theory</h4><p>Triarchic theory has found its application in various domains:</p><ul><li><strong>Education: </strong>this would help teachers to design instructional approaches based on the cognitive needs of the students.</li><li><strong>Assessment: </strong>development of various tools and techniques based on analytical, creative, and contextual aspects of an individual which would help in providing a more comprehensive profile.</li><li><strong>Career Assessment:</strong> to assess the individual’s professional aspect and guide them through proper alignment.</li><li><strong>Research:</strong> this theory has led to many new theories and conceptualizations.</li><li><strong>Interventions</strong>: this theory has helped many therapists in formulating many strategies for coping with many cognitive challenges.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, Sternberg’s Triarchic Theory illuminates intelligence through analytical, creative, and practical dimensions. Despite criticisms, it finds application in education, assessment, and therapeutic interventions.</p><p><strong>Read More Articles from psychologs</strong></p><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Education</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Are You Dealing with a Megalomaniac?&nbsp;</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 2, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Education</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Understanding Bipolar: Coping with Different Types</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 2, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Education</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Understanding Seasonal Migraine Triggers: Myths, Causes, and Coping</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Education</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Navigating Life’s Transitions: Academics and Beyond</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Education</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Experts Speak: The Psychology behind Voting and Election</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 27, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmraqZlr%2BktMicZK2glaS%2FunnOn2SipqSaua21xp6lnJ1f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-are-people-being-so-insensitivity.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WHY ARE PEOPLE BEING SO INSENSITIVE ?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-ditka.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Megan Ditka Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
