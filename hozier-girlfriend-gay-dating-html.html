His very first single, Take Me To Church, became an international sensation and was certified as multi-platinum in various countries.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Along with hitting the headlines with his international success stories, Hozier has also been surrounded by gay rumors.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Amassing Impressive Net Worth While Tackling Gay Rumors</h2><p dir=ltr>His first-ever hit - also his first musical introduction to masses - Take Me To Church embodied his Blues background to its core.</p><p dir=ltr>Despite the changing landscape of the music business, Hozier remains true to his lineage, crafting one conscious record after another without intent to land his next big hit. His second studio album, "Wasteland, Baby!" released in March 2019 under British label Island Records, doesn't stray from his Blues roots.</p><p dir=ltr>His integrity and unwillingness to give in to the musical trends have only widened his fanbase, which meant an increase in album and tour ticket sales. With his fantastic popularity and success, the 31-year-old Irish rocker definitely boasts a net worth of millions.</p><p dir=ltr><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-191 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>To think that it all began with the music video for Take Me To Church going viral is mind-boggling. The four-minute-long clip received notoriety for its pro-LGBTQIA+ messaging. Without reading much into the song's lyrics, detractors quickly labeled Hozier a closeted gay.</p><p dir=ltr>Months later, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">clarified</a> that the song is much about sex and humanity. He states that sex and humanity are tied together, and regardless of any sexual orientation, it just natural, but the church says that it is doctrine and sinful. However, he also claims that the song is not an attack on faith.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>“The song is about asserting yourself and reclaiming your humanity through an act of love… But it’s not an attack on faith... it’s an assertion of self, reclaiming humanity back for something that is the most natural and worthwhile…”</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Fellow Irish Export With Respectable Wealth:-</strong> <a href=# rel=follow>Colin Farrell Wife, Dating, Children, Net Worth</a></p><h2 dir=ltr>Dating Irish Girlfriend? Previous Relationships&nbsp;</h2><p dir=ltr>Hozier’s life has been highlighted by his glamorous career, but he has also been the talk of the town for being linked with several celebrities in the past.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>He allegedly dated his rumored girlfriend<a href=# rel=follow> Saoirse Ronan</a>, an Irish actress best known for her work in Lady Bird. The rumored lovebirds initially fueled the dating gossip in the spring of 2017 after they got spotted enjoying a string of intimate dates. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-192 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Hozier stands next to his rumored girlfriend, Saoirse Ronan</strong>(Photo:- irrishmirror. ie)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p dir=ltr>But after the musician got spotted with a mystery brunette later that year, reports claimed that the relationship between the two was a done and dusted affair. Hozier and his rumored girlfriend, Ronan, developed a bond while working on the former's video for his song Cherry Wine a year earlier in 2016.</p><p>The Nina Cried Power crooner's other industry romance includes fellow musician <a href=# rel=follow>Taylor Swift</a>.

Maybe, it's why he doesn't advertise his dating life online.</p><p dir=ltr><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-194 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Thus, it is safe to assume that the musician doesn’t have a girlfriend, let alone be married to a wife.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>More About Hozier&nbsp;</h2><p dir=ltr>Pre-fame, Hozier, real name Andrew Hozier-Bryne, was an aspiring musician, having toured the world with the renowned Irish choral group Anuna between 2009 and 2012.</p><p dir=ltr>A year before joining the band, he had dropped out of the prestigious musical program at Trinity College in his native Ireland to record demos for Universal Music.</p><p dir=ltr>Born on 17th March 1990, Hozier of Irish nationality primarily learned musicianship trades from his parents -his father John, a member of Dublin-based blues band Free Booze, more so than mother Raine. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-195 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr><strong>Bio Of Blues Legend:- </strong><a href=# rel=follow>Openly Gay Johnny Mathis Married?
