Since 2018, Reilly has graced the big screens as Beth Dutton on the Paramount Network hit show “Yellowstone.” Apart from “Yellowstone,” the actress has appeared in popular films such as “True Detective,” “Sherlock Holmes,” “Above Suspicion,” and “Haunting in Venice.”&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, Baugher was just a regular guy before he met actress Kelly Reilly. Since marrying her, many people, especially Reilly’s fans, have wanted to know more about him. Here’s everything we know about the actress’ husband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-03_13-17-45-fotor-20230703132231-682x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Kelly_Reillys_Husband></span>Who Is Kelly Reilly’s Husband?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kyle Baugher was born to his parents, Kathleen and Harry, on July 18, 1977. He hails from Southampton, New York, United States. The actress’s husband is an American of white ethnicity who grew up in a Christian household. While Kyle Baugher has revealed the identity of his parents, he has not provided details regarding his siblings on public domains.&nbsp;</p><p>There are no details regarding his elementary and high school education. However, after he graduated high school, Baugher enrolled at Princeton University in New Jersey in 1998. There, he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in History in 2002.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-03_13-18-11-fotor-2023070313212.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Kyle_Baugher_Do_for_a_Living></span>What Does Kyle Baugher Do for a Living?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Unlike his wife, the Princeton University alum is not into entertainment. After he graduated from the university, Baugher pursued a business career and started working as a financier. In addition, he spends time working in investment companies.&nbsp;</p><p>However, despite being in the limelight, the celebrity spouse has not shared any information regarding his career. Hence, there are no details regarding when he started working as a financier in New York or how high the ladder he has climbed in the corporate world.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Kyle_Baugher_Meet_Kelly_Reilly></span>When Did Kyle Baugher Meet Kelly Reilly?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Baugher and Reilly first met in Marta, Texas, in 2010. They hit it off and started dating. Their relationship progressed quickly, and they soon got engaged. Kyle Baugher and Kelly Reilly exchanged wedding vows two years later in 2012. The love birds had a dreamy wedding ceremony with their friends and family in attendance in Somerset, England.</p><p>However, unlike her character Beth Dutton in “Yellowstone,” Reilly is much more tight-lipped about her personal life. She rarely speaks about her husband, and the few times she talked about him in her interviews were to credit him for making her return to the theater. The celebrity couple has been together for over a decade, but they keep their marriage away from the media.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-03_13-18-06-fotor-20230703132135.jpg><p>While Kyle Baugher has not revealed details regarding his past relationships, his famous wife, on the other hand, almost tied the knot with another man before meeting him. Before she met the American financier, Reilly was dating an Israeli-born American actor, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jonah Lotan</a>.</p><p>Like Reilly, Lotan is a famous actor renowned for his role as Dr. Marty Pino on “CSI: NY” and Rudy McCoy in the second season of the “Homeland” series. Their relationship blossomed, and the pair took it further by getting engaged in 2007. However, they broke off their engagement in 2009, and Reilly searched for love outside the entertainment business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kyle_Baughers_Children></span>Kyle Baugher’s Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Baugher and his spouse are very private about their marriage and have never revealed anything outside their work. However, the actress has never mentioned having children, and she has no photos of her with children on any of her social media pages.</p><p>Hence, the celebrity couple doesn’t have kids yet.&nbsp;However, they have a dog that the “Yellowstone” star describes as her “hairy baby.” Reilly also frequently posts the pet on her Instagram account.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Kelly_Reillys_Husband_Have_a_Social_Media_Presence></span>Does Kelly Reilly’s Husband Have a Social Media Presence?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, he doesn’t. Kyle Baugher is incredibly low-key and does not have a social media presence. The celebrity spouse enjoys his private marriage with Reilly and does not have a social media account on any social media platforms. However, his wife will occasionally post pictures of him on her Instagram.</p><p>On the other hand, Reilly has an Instagram account with over 700,000 followers. Reilly keeps up with her Instagram account, seemingly to stay relevant by posting pictures from the set of “Yellowstone” and letting the show’s fans comment on them. Reilly only has a photo with Kyle Baugher on her <a href=#>Instagram</a>, which she posted on New Year’s Day, 2020, with a caption that reads, “Another year of love..so grateful for you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-03_13-17-59-fotor-20230703132158.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Kyle_Baughers_Net_Worth></span>What Is Kyle Baugher’s Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Due to Baugher’s low-key lifestyle, it is difficult to determine his exact net worth. However, online reports suggest that the American financier and businessman has a net worth ranging between $1,000,000 – $2,000,000. In addition, his famous wife also has a net worth of $5,000,000, which she made from her career as an actress.&nbsp;</p><p>Kyle Baugher and Kelly Reilly separate their personal life from work and have been together for over a decade, like <a href=#>Anne Hathaway and Adam Shulman</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqOpobJursCunqGdomKupMDRnqqsZZuaua3FjKucoqScrsButNSsmZqmlGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./beyonce-yacht-diving-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Beyonce Enjoys Crazy Yacht Diving</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-middleton-pictured-meghan-markle-prince-harry-wedding-reception.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Smiling Princess Kate pictured behind the scenes at Meghan Markle's royal wedding reception</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
