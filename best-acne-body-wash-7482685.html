And there’s no doubt about it — body acne can be discouraging, especially as temperatures rise. The more skin we show, the more frustrating it is to have to deal with bacne, buttne, and any other breakouts below the neck.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Acne spot treatments have their place, but they’re not the easiest products to use when you’re getting dressed and headed out the door, which is why acne body washes are such a valuable tool in the skin-clearing arsenal.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While there used to only be a few reliable options available, now you’ll find stocked shelves filled with acne body washes everywhere from your local drugstore to Sephora. To get rid of our acne and blackheads for good, we set out to find the best acne body washes out there by sudsing up with the 15 most popular options. We scrutinized the effectiveness, consistency, hydration, and overall cleansing ability of each body wash for six weeks. We ranked each body wash based on our results, and whether it cleared up our acne completely and effectively. We also took note of how well it lathered and felt on our skin. The highest-ranking body washes earned a spot on our list..</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-kosas-good-body-skin-aha--enzyme-exfoliating-body-wash></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kosas Good Body Skin AHA + Enzyme Exfoliating Body Wash</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kosas Good Body Skin AHA + Enzyme Exfoliating Body Wash" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MWteW2WF2J1JxoDcqSGp9i8mDHE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kosas-good-body-skin-aha---enzyme-exfoliating-body-wash-158e1575734943e3b14ff1f6a0f9dbbf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Cleansing Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This effective formula has an unexpectedly lovely smell for such a potent treatment.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The strength of this formula is not to be underestimated by those with sensitive complexions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This product from Kosas is a real winner and, in our humble opinion, should be on everyone’s shower shelf. We thought the gender-neutral and aesthetically pleasing bottle was a nice touch, as was the scent of the well-lathering gel — reminiscent of a seaside bungalow, with fragrance notes of jasmine, orange flower, and sandalwood. (If you regularly use acne products, you know that something that works and smells pleasant can be quite the rarity.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s not just Good Body Skin’s look, feel, and smell that we loved —&nbsp;it was the way it works, too. It features a triple acid blend of lactic, glycolic, and mandelic, plus exfoliating fruit enzymes that helped resurface our skin, removing the dead cells that clogged our pores. The formula also contains allantoin to prevent overstripping. We found that a small amount lathered well and was able to cover a lot of skin, so we were able to treat large areas of your body without being wasteful, and though it’s a small detail, the cap never got gunky, so the formula came out smoothly with every pour.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep in mind that while the packaging is playful, the formula inside isn’t here to play —&nbsp;it’s here to work. The bottle doesn’t provide usage instructions, although it likely won’t be something that those with especially sensitive skin can use daily. The powerful formula didn’t bug our normal complexions, but if your skin is easily irritated, we would recommend slowly integrating this product into your routine once weekly to determine your skin’s tolerance before building up your usage to a daily cadence.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Glycolic acid, lactic acid, fruit enzymes <strong>| Skin Type: </strong>Normal, oily, acne prone, dry <strong>| Size: </strong>9 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-panoxyl-acne-foaming-wash></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>PanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="PanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sNOliMuJo_3LYSLHCQJBzeOUvJo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/panoxyl-acne-foaming-wash-benzoyl-peroxide-10-d4c15622cac445e5a422fd88579c5820.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Cleansing Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This budget-friendly, medicinal treatment really works without leaving skin feeling dehydrated.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>While we appreciate that it’s a no-frills product from a clinical perspective, we do wish the packaging and branding had a bit more flair to stand up to other products in our routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking to seriously combat acne without hurting your wallet, PanOxyl is a time-honored favorite. It’s loaded with benzoyl peroxide, a hard-hitting ingredient proven to fight acne, at the highest concentration available over the counter —&nbsp;any stronger, and you’d need to get it prescribed by a dermatologist. Despite this, we were pleased to find that the formula is truly moisturizing, which is often hard to get from an acne body wash, and it seriously delivered on its promises, giving us&nbsp;clearer, smoother, calmer skin that was noticeably less oily post-cleanse.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to being a potent antibacterial agent, benzoyl peroxide is recognized as an anti-inflammatory ingredient, so it’ll soothe redness and painful tender bumps. We saw proof of this when using it during our testing period, including along the bikini line, where it reduced formation of (and discomfort from) ingrown hairs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, if you’re someone who appreciates a sense of style from their skincare routine, you may be left wanting by the PanOxyl packaging. While it wouldn’t be out of place on the shelf of a doctor’s office, it didn’t mesh well with our existing stylish in-shower lineup. That said, if you care more about efficacy than aesthetic, grab a bottle of this one and check it out for yourself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Benzoyl peroxide<strong> | Skin Type: </strong>Normal, oily, acne prone<strong> | Size: </strong>5.5 oz</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2688 data-sizes=750px alt="PanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BXqjcq4mvrhqz2qmXtp1bsd0fq8=/fit-in/1500x2688/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-acne-body-washes-test-panoxyl-acne-creamy-wash-sara-luckey-01-f0ece07dc60e4e13832bdbef18d8d2c4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Sara Luckey</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2688 data-sizes=750px alt="PanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ge2ibZDM0sUt-KGN3sz0_XF6z7o=/fit-in/1500x2688/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-acne-body-washes-test-panoxyl-acne-creamy-wash-sara-luckey-02-0c2bd0d6d51941328dd138478b29ca93.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Sara Luckey</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-dermatologist-recommended-murad-acne-control-acne-body-wash></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Dermatologist-Recommended</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Murad Acne Control Body Wash</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Murad Acne Control Acne Body Wash" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/b3HKTNBIh8EknWWkEOkAXpmx5fA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Murad-Acne-Body-Wash-4343e7b1e4a5458dbb742247a09ca9dd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Cleansing Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This formula effectively eradicated bumps and tamed breakouts.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The physical exfoliant is pretty gentle, but still may be too harsh for regular use by someone with sensitive skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved how this dermatologist-developed formula cut right through dirt and oil on our bods to combat breakouts and bumpy skin with three types of exfoliants: AHA glycolic acid, BHA salicylic acid, and date seed powder particles. Though we found that it didn’t provide a lather at all (which may be a dealbreaker for some), the gel formula gave our skin a satisfyingly smooth feel with tiny grains, courtesy of the date seed powder, leaving us feeling silky, not abraded.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though this product is the priciest on our list, we determined that a little of the formula went a long way, giving you a bang for your buck. In fact, we even found ourselves using it once weekly on our faces in addition to the thrice-weekly body cleanse because of how well it cleared up our bacne.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only caveat is that while this formula isn’t exactly stripping, it’s not moisturizing either, which is something to consider if your skin is on the dry or sensitive side. We tested this product in winter, so we definitely needed to moisturize after use. If your skin is super sensitive, be aware that a triple-threat exfoliant could cause irritation. The date seed powder granules are small and didn’t leave us feeling itchy at all, but regular reliance on this formula may overly sensitize your skin, which is a no-no when treating breakouts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Salicylic acid, glycolic acid, date seed powder<strong> | Skin Type: </strong>Normal, oily, acne prone, sensitive<strong> | Size: </strong>8.5 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-chest-zitsticka-silkshake-body-wash></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Chest</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ZitSticka Silkshake Body Wash</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ZitSticka Silkshake Body Wash" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5BlhW_rn2NCy_2XhvKMN6MaSnD0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ZitSticka-Silkshake-Body-Cleanser-7575d262e96540a9b2cbbfb82e8bfa3e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bluemercury</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Cleansing Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This gentle formula contains a unique blend of acne-fighting ingredients that effectively treat breakouts, yet won’t sensitize easily-irritated skin.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Because it’s mild, don’t expect this product to instantly clear up congested skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like many with blemish-prone skin, we faced a common challenge when working out — a spike in the number of pimples on our chest and shoulders — but this option from breakout-fighting brand, ZitSticka, calmed the acne on our chest and kept our skin feeling healthy, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Instead of the usual suspects, like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, this wash uses a blend of pre-, pro-, and postbiotics to support a healthy microbiome for happier and clearer skin, plus tea tree at a low percentage to help gently unclog pores.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Right off the bat, the texture of the formula signaled to us that it would condition our skin, and we were right — this creamy body wash sealed in moisture while helping to soothe our distressed skin and softening rough texture, including the bumpy skin on the backs of our arms caused by keratosis pilaris. Instead of feeling dry and tight, a sensation that many acne body washes can cause, our skin felt comfortable and soft after cleansing with Silkshake.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After six weeks of use, we had fewer blemishes and they were less red and painful than usual, with a less blotchy appearance to our skin.

The fresh-feeling and smelling (and neon green!) formula cut right through our natural body oils and any grime from the day with a foamy lather that brightened, soothed, and clarified our skin. That was thanks to three different alpha-hydroxy acids — glycolic, lactic, and malic — along with pore-clearing willow bark, and calming cica and oat protein.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The packaging is fully recyclable in at-home bins, which we appreciated, as not all empties are easy to recycle. It also holds a large amount of body wash, a little of which went a long way.

In addition to featuring salicylic acid, it uses kakadu plum, aloe, vitamin B, and coffee seed extract to brighten, hydrate, and firm for an overall rejuvenated look. After six weeks of testing, we found that the blemishes that used to dot our body were few and far between, smaller, and far less painful than usual.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only downside of this formula is that it’s not the most efficacious cleanser of the ones we tried, and extra-dirty days would need a double cleanse.

If you add too much water, the body wash thins out and tends to spread a bit too easily to treat specific areas. That said, this allows us to use the formula in two ways — as an all-over body refresher or a targeted acne treatment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Tea tree, glycerin, Alexandrian laurel seed oil<strong> | Skin Type: </strong>Normal, oily, acne prone <strong>| Size: </strong>8.4 fl oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After researching the best acne body washes available on the market, we narrowed down the list to the 15 most popular products currently available and shipped them to our team of InStyle editors to test.

These are considered drugs and approved by the FDA to treat acne; salicylic acid can be found at a maximum concentration of two percent in over-the-counter formulas while benzoyl peroxide is available at a concentration of up to 10 percent. Anything stronger, and you’ll need a prescription.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid that not only exfoliates and unclogs pores, but since it is a derivative of acetyl salicylic acid or aspirin, it is also anti-inflammatory to the oil gland,” explains board-certified dermatologist Dr. Kenneth Mark. This is one of the active ingredients in both <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Murad Acne Body Wash</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Frank Body Clearing Body Wash</a>. “Benzoyl peroxide also has more than one mechanism of action and it is comedolytic, which means it exfoliates and unclogs pores, inhibits the oil glands’ production of sebum, and is also antibacterial,” says Dr. Mark. Benzoyl peroxide is also an anti-inflammatory, making it a good choice for painful acne bumps.

Rochester-based board-certified dermatologist Dr. Anar Mikailov suggests looking for ingredients like zinc pyrithione, ketoconazole, or selenium sulfide.

If you have oily skin or live in a humid part of the world, you might want to go for a gel or a foam. “The more oily your skin, the more drying the cleanser you look for should be,” says Dr. Mark. These textures will best cut through grease and debris. “Those with drier skin types or live in a drier climate may like creamier textures,” says Dr. Mikailov. Creamy formulas tend to be much more moisturizing; a rich texture like what you’ll find in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">ZitSticka Silkshake Body Cleanser</a> may also be best for you if you have more sensitive skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Acne body washes with physical exfoliants are not uncommon, but proceed with caution here, says Dr. Mikailov. “Make sure the exfoliants are gentle and smooth — I prefer ones that are jojoba oil wax esters as they do not harm the environment while they’re perfectly spherical and won’t cause microtears in the skin,” he explains.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Your Skin Sensitivity</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ingredients that can treat acne can also really dehydrate the skin —&nbsp;and that’s kind of the whole point, as they’re targeting the oil glands in the skin. “It is rare for someone with sensitive skin to have significant body acne, but if they do, they should avoid gels and alcohol-based products, which can be exceedingly drying,” says Dr. Mark.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Mikailov also suggests looking for formulas that are fragrance-free, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Body Wash</a>, the aroma of which comes from the tea tree in the product, as well as restricting your use to two to three times a week rather than every day.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I use a body wash for acne?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Every <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>body wash formula</a> is different and will have different usage instructions on the packaging, so definitely start there. However, you’ll likely get the best results from using it daily, twice daily if your skin can tolerate it. If your skin is on the sensitive side, try using it three to four times a week instead.
