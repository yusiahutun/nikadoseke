It’s the adrenaline that they crave and keeps them going. However, drivers do have dreams outside the F1 grid as Sebastian Vettel depicted by retiring from the sport. <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Max Verstappen</a> was responsible for stealing Lewis Hamilton’s dream of becoming an 8x World Champion from his hands. And now the other Red Bull driver might be the reason behind the Briton losing another dream of his. Let’s find out what<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9> Sergio Perez</a> is up to and how he might shatter Hamilton’s dream.</p><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Lewis Hamilton</a> has always wanted to star in a Top Gun movie with Tom Cruise. The Briton revealed his dream and even asked Tom Cruise to give him a role in the Top Gun franchise. Hamilton was so desperate that he was ready to star as even a janitor. Tom Cruise kept his word and offered Lewis the role of a fighter pilot in Top Gun 2. However, Lewis wasn’t able to accept that offer as he was tangled up in a championship.</p><p>Red Bull recently posted a video of Sergio Perez on Instagram where the Mexican is seen sitting on the Moto GP challenger of Marc Marquez. F1 teams do these promotional events where they swap the Moto GP drivers and F1 drivers along with their machinery. Lewis Hamilton did a similar event with Valentino Rossi. Many fans pointed out Sergio Perez’s uncanny resemblance to Tom Cruise and were reminded of the bike chase scene from Mission Impossible 2.</p><p>Fans in the comments section of the video begged Red Bull to post the full video as they wished for the Mexican minister of defense to star in the upcoming Top Gun movie owing to his resemblance to the protagonist of the franchise. The fan reactions and comments may break Lewis Hamilton’s dream of working in the next Top Gun movie. The 7X world champion already mentioned that he would not let the opportunity of starring in the next franchise movie.</p><p>However, Lewis Hamilton has started his own production company and is <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>working with Brad Pitt on a new Formula 1 movie</a>. Even if the dream of working with Tom Cruise remains unfulfilled, the Mercedes driver will still have the privilege of producing a movie with one of the biggest stars. Let’s see how fans have reacted to Checo’s attempts at breaking Lewis Hamilton’s dream.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Fans react to Sergio Perez trying Marc Marquez’s Moto GP challenger</strong></h2><p>The comment section of the Instagram video was blown up by the fans, who took the chance and presented Checo as Tom Cruise. Some suggested the video was a scene from the upcoming Top Gun movie, whereas others changed the name of the franchise altogether in favor of a MotoGP and Checo-themed title. There were also many who played around with Perez’s name by adding Tom Cruise’s last name to Sergio’s. However, the most notable one was someone called Checo the Mexican Tom Cruise. Here’s how the fans reacted on Instagram:</p><p>“Tom Cruise in Top Gun”<br>“Awesome to see Tom Cruise on a MotoGP Bike”<br>“Tom Checo Minister of Defense wait for the movie”<br>“Sergio Cruise for the RedBull Maverick Moto GP team”<br>“He’s the Mexican Tom Cruise”<br>“Checo Cruise”<br>“Maybe Top Gun 3?”<br>“I can see the Tom Cruise in him now”<br>“That’s my Tom Cruise ❤️ and this year’s champion🔥”<br>“I’m glad I’m not the only one who sees the resemblance😂 and while we’re at it, Alonso looks like Jeffrey Dean Morgan🤔”<br>“Tom Cruise ready to perform new stunts”<br>“Mission Impossible 2 brought to you by Tom Cruise”<br>“Tom Perez or Checo Cruise”</p><p>The fans will latch onto every single possibility of relating a famous person to a celebrity. Like one person suggested how Fernando Alonso looks like Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Whether Lewis Hamilton stars in the next Top Gun movie is still unsure, but Sergio Perez sure does pose as a strong candidate.</p><p><strong>Watch this Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>From Tom Cruise to Emily Ratajkowski: Celebrities to Drive an F1 Car</span></a></strong></p><p>What do you make of the fans reacting to the Red Bull video?
