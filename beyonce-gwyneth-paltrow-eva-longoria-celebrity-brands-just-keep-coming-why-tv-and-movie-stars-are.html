Why not endorse your own products?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/08/d281f4c8-3f39-4c1a-b92e-f4e2354d7842_e8fef536.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although the practice of film and TV stars leveraging their fame to sell a product is nothing new (it dates back to the 1800s) and working actors and actresses have traditionally supplemented their income with side jobs, a significant number are now launching their own brands instead of endorsing or partnering with existing companies.</p>Sorenson says the idea of building a business from the ground up is attractive to stars seeking creative autonomy. It also solves what Sorenson called the “potential problem” of attaching one’s name to a company that may misbehave or a product that may have quality issues that are out of the their control. A number of Hong Kong celebrities learned this the hard way with the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">recent JPEX scandal</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Plus, there is a bigger cut for talent with a higher stake in a profitable business.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">For me to have my own brand … I am able to make decisions that I know my audience will likeTia Mowry, actress</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Why should the celebrity be willing to take a few 100,000 or maybe even a few million dollars for their endorsement, when they’re responsible for the success of the product?” he says. “By taking on a little bit of risk … they potentially own 60, 70, 80 per cent or more of the product.”</p>Creative control was especially important to actress Tia Mowry when founding 4U, a haircare line for <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">textured hair</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mowry recalls not being permitted to make certain recipes while hosting her Food Network show Tia Mowry at Home because they “didn’t speak to” the network’s audience. Now Mowry has the freedom to cater to her own audience through her webseries Tia Mowry’s Quick Fix and 4U.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ve been in this industry for such a long time,” Mowry says. “When you’re working for someone, you’re boxed in.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For me to have my own brand … I am able to make decisions that I know my audience will like,” which has led to greater success, she adds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition to providing more creative license, actress Dominique Fishback says running her own business has allowed her to operate on her timeline, instead of being constricted to another company’s schedule.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/08/a4417017-a676-414e-8e07-c5c585d32761_8a66ae79.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Sometimes when we wait for a partnership, or wait for somebody else to give the go-ahead or to agree to come on board, it holds up whatever it is that you wanted to do,” Fishback says. “And so I thought, ‘Let me just do it now.’”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The actress launched her business – an online journal and apparel shop called Be Yourself, Love – earlier this year with the help of her loved ones. She made a conscious decision to go into business with people who “cared about the brand and the mission, but cared about the person more”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t know what’s gonna happen or how big it’s gonna get,” Fishback says. “But you have to start somewhere.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Are celebrity drinks, like Dwayne Johnson’s Teremana tequila, worth the hype?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Paul Yoo, head of ventures and licensing at United Talent Agency, says the starting point for all of their clients who want to launch a business is passion. Typically, talent will approach Yoo’s team with an idea, having already “deeply thought about where their creative efforts can live in another medium”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then the agency helps them bring their idea to fruition by providing them with the practical tools they need to run their business, as well as access to experts who can “handle the execution of their vision”, Yoo says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A key part of that process, Yoo explains, is identifying a “reason to exist” – or a void in the marketplace that the talent can fill – and analysing what competitors are already doing in that space, to give their client’s brand a better chance to succeed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/08/46857b3f-1e33-4f01-98f1-24c9ec927450_4c3bc3f2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The “reason to exist” factor was top of mind for Mowry when developing 4U. After cutting off her chemically straightened locks and embarking on her natural hair journey in 2012, she struggled to find products that met her specific needs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Enter Mowry’s 4U, billed as a textured curl care line that uses sustainable ingredients, from rosemary and sea moss to flaxseed and watermelon extract.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition to working with scientists to develop formulas that were “natural and safe and clean”, Mowry was heavily involved in the branding process for 4U.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For example, she came up with the idea to display the “star ingredient” on the front of the bottle so customers could make informed decisions about what they were putting in their hair.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wanted to make this line accessible,” Mowry says “I’m passionate about everybody having the right to have access to healthy, clean, good products.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">It’s never been easier to start a companyPaul Yoo, United Talent Agency</figure>Organic ingredients and product transparency were also priorities for actress Freida Pinto, co-founder of Rookie Wellness – a US-made line of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">vegan protein powder</span></a> and nutritional supplements free of sugar, soy and gluten.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a business partner, the Slumdog Millionaire star is among the first to test new products for Rookie Wellness and offer feedback that is incorporated into the final version.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pinto was concerned that one particular Rookie Wellness product – Wake, a fruity energy supplement meant to be taken in the morning – tasted too sweet. Adjustments were made, and Wake is now the company’s most popular item.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/08/5f29e796-78f3-430c-b844-1a72824f6bec_095c17fb.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Top Hollywood talent agencies have recently created entire departments devoted to supporting their clients’ entrepreneurial activities and ambitions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s never been easier to start a company,” Yoo says. “For those that are really thoughtful about building it for the long term, they’ve seen outsize rewards. And as a result of all of those things happening, we’re continuously seeing a spike in demand.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Of course, a celebrity name does not guarantee success. Last month, Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard’s baby product line Hello Bello filed for bankruptcy, and numerous celebrity restaurants and clothing lines (actress Natalie Portman’s Té Casan shoe line and singer Britney Spears’ Nyla restaurant, to name two) have failed over the years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even the wealthiest celebrity brands – such as the Honest Co. and Goop – have faced their share of controversies and legal woes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/08/a9525de6-9502-43e2-abc5-dab13342a7da_ed18453d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still, actors and other entertainment luminaries continue to take the leap of faith in hopes that their business endeavours will not only survive but thrive in the booming celebrity-brand economy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I thought it was important for my community – meaning the diverse community – to see that something like this can be done,” Mowry says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wanted to be an example … if you have something – a dream, a passion, something on your mind – it can be done.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLKvwMSrq5qhnqKyr8COmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkW1ncG5nZK%2Bmxc6nmp5ll6zGr7HToWSpmZypv7DDjJ6tmmWcpLuou9GimGablaGyo77IrbBmmqKWu6W%2FjKOsrKxdoLKmvIycpqahnpx6uLTYZquvZZGjsW65zq%2BgnmWjqa6zv4yaqZ4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jo-dee-messina-new-music-ben-fuller-he-got-ahold-of-me.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jo Dee Messina Drops Details on Her Huge Summer of New Music</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./allegations-democrat-katie-porters-abusive-marriage-resurface-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Allegations about Democrat Katie Porter's abusive marriage resurface</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
