One woman who knows that for sure is his wife, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kylie Kelce</a> </strong>(née <strong>McDevitt</strong>), who married him in 2018, two months after Jason and the Eagles won Super Bowl LII. Since then, Jason and Kylie have lived spectacular lives on and off the field by starting a family and giving back to their community. The entire Kelce family has been in the spotlight even more now thanks to Jason’s brother <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a>‘s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>relationship</a> with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>So, who is the woman who Jason calls his better half? Read on to learn more about Kylie Kelce and her marriage to Jason Kelce.</p><h2>1. How Did Jason & Kylie Meet?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Apparently, these two lovebirds found themselves on Tinder. While the exact details of their first date are unclear, Kylie hinted that Jason came one finger stroke away from missing out on the love of his life. “Thank goodness you swiped right, too,” she captioned <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a November 2015 photo</a> of them together. In 2015, Jason was four years into his NFL career and three years away from helping the Eagles win their first-ever Super Bowl championship by defeating the New England Patriots. After that 2015 post, Jason constantly appeared on Kylie’s Instagram.</p><h2>2. Did Kylie McDevitt Play Any Sports?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Sports run in the Kelce family. Kylie McDevitt played field hockey through high school and college at Pennsylvania’s Cabrini University. Her last season before graduating in 2017 was in 2016, and she had quite the impressive senior season. According to her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cabrini Athletics bio</a>, she was named to the All-CSAC First Team and the ECAC South All-Stars First Team. And although her position is listed as defense, she had five goals and five assists through her season.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>She reflected on playing college field hockey in a<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> sentimental post</a> she shared in April 2019. “One of the best decisions I’ve ever made was to become a part of the Cabrini Field Hockey family,” Kylie wrote alongside several images of her in action.</p><h2>3. When Did Jason Kelce Get Married?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Jason and Kylie walked down the aisle on April 14, 2018, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Philadelphia magazine</a>. The two tied the knot at the Logan Hotel. “He went from a regular athlete whom I had never heard of to a Super Bowl champion who made such an impression on the city,” <strong>Sarah Alderman</strong>, their wedding photographer, told the magazine. “I don’t follow football, but I’ve been raising my twins as a single mom since they were born, and I grew up with a single mom, and I feel very familiar to [the] underdog thing. When I saw Kelce’s speech, I started crying hysterically. His whole mentality and his approach to life just really hit me hard. I thought, ‘This is my groom.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Roughly 170 guests attended the wedding. It seemed to be a short engagement, as Philly photographer <strong>Hugh E Dillion</strong> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>claimed</a> that Jason bought the engagement ring and wedding bands “six weeks” before the wedding.</p><h2>4. Do Jason & Kylie Have Any Kids?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>“Just giving credit where credit is due… And to all the people who told me I was glowing… that was sweat,” Kylie captioned an August 2019<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> IG post</a> of her wearing a shirt reading “62 DID THIS,” with an arrow pointing down to her baby bump. Two months later, Jason and Kylie became parents for the first time. “Chunked up the Deuces on her way out,” Jason captioned a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> of Kylie and their newborn. “Wyatt Elizabeth Kelce. 10/2/2019. 8lbs 6 oz,” he said, revealing his daughter’s name to the world.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Two years later, the couple <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed</a> their second daughter, <strong>Elliotte Ray Kelce</strong>. Their third daughter, <b>Bennett Llewellyn</b>, was born in February 2023, after Jason <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>played against his brother Travis</a> (and lost) in Super Bowl LII. Kylie was very pregnant with her third child at the game. On a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pre-Super Bowl episode</a> of the New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce podcast, Jason said, “I’m also bringing Kylie’s [Jason’s wife] parents]. Kylie’s bringing her OB because she’s going to be 38 weeks pregnant at the game. That could be a super Kelce Bowl. If she has a baby in the stadium, it’s officially scripted.”</p><h2>5. Kylie Loves To Give Back</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>Kylie has a beautiful life to be thankful for, and she likes to give back in any way she can. During the summer of 2022, she helped raise $150,000 for the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Eagles Autism Foundation</a> along with New Jersey’s popular <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Ocean Drive</a> bar. “Thank you to everyone that came out and supported this incredible event. Ferdog, the owners and the entire team at the OD, the Eagles staff members, the EAF staff, and all of the vendors that participated made this event soar,” she captioned a carousel of photos and a video from the event (seen above), which included one of a joyful-looking <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Donna Kelce</strong></a>, Jason and Travis’ mother.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Kylie participated the year before, which was the first time the event was held. She revealed it raised 50,000 in a heartfelt <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> caption.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8maqqimXaCyra%2FEZq6inpVignF9j2tsbGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-ditka.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Megan Ditka Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./animal-abuse-hong-kong-street-dogs-most-likely-be-victims-and-suspects.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Animal abuse in Hong Kong: street dogs most likely to be victims, and suspects often avoid prosecuti</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
