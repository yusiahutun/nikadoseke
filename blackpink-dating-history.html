BLINKs believe lack of information around <a href=# rel=noopener>BLACKPINK’s dating history</a> is because of YG Entertainment’s “dating ban,” which prohibits some YG Entertainment artists, such as BLACKPINK, from having romantic relationships while in the band.</p><p>BLACKPINK confirmed this in an interview on JYP’s Party People in 2017, where the band also revealed that they can’t smoke, drink, go to clubs or get tattoos or plastic surgery. However, Jennie did note that there’s an exception to the ban, which is that any rule can be broken as long as YG Entertainment’s former CEO Yang Hyun-Suk gives his permission.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>This exception was evident when the members told the hosts of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Party People</a> that they went to a club and drank for the first time since their debut when they visited Park Jin Young on a club-like set. (Though it wasn’t a real club, the members were still very excited.) “We broke two taboos today, drinking and clubbing. It’s a historic day,” Jennie said at the time, while Lisa added, “It’s my first time at a club.”</p><p>That said, we understand why <a href=# rel=noopener>BLACKPINK</a>‘s members have put their romantic lives on the back burner for the past few years. As one of the most famous acts in K-pop right now, it makes sense that <a href=# rel=noopener>BLACKPINK </a>is more focused on their career. Though that hasn’t stopped the many, many dating rumors about them over the years. Find out everything <a href=# rel=noopener>Lisa, Jisoo, Jennie and Rosé</a> have said about dating and relationships&nbsp;ahead.</p><h2>Jennie</h2><p>Jennie is the only member of BLACKPINK to have a confirmed relationship while in the band. The rapper and singer dated EXO’s Kai from October 2018 to January 2019. SM Entertainment, EXO’s management company, confirmed the couple’s relationship in December 2018 after the two were <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">photographed on a date</a> together. (Fans started to speculate about their relationship in October 2018 after Kai and Jennie both posted romantic photos in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris around the same time.) However, by January 2019, the romance was over. SM Entertainment confirmed toward the end of the month that the two were no long dating. “It is true that Kai and Jennie have recently parted ways,” the company said in a statement. As for why they broke up, a source told Naver at the time that the two <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">split because of their schedules</a>. The insider claimed that Kai and Jennie wanted to focus on their careers but they ended their relationship as friends.</p><p>In February 2021, Dispatch, a South Korean media outlet, reported that Jennie and BIGBANG’s G-Dragon had been dating for a year. The two previously collaborated on his 2013 song “BLACK.” According to Dispatch, G-Dragon had a personal parking lot and a private elevator at his penthouse, which Jennie would use visit him in secret. The outlet reported that Jennie would often go to G-Dragon’s house after her daily schedule for BLACKPINK. According to Dispatch, YG Entertainment knew of Jennie and G-Dragon’s relationship. The outlet also reported that Jennie’s manager, as well as G-Dragon’s manager, would often drive her to and from his house. Dispatch first saw Jennie leaving G-Dragon’s house on January 31, 2021, the day of BLACKPINK’s online concert, “The Show.” The outlet reported that they saw Jennie leaving G-Dragon’s house that morning to head to the concert venue. G-Dragon’s car was also seen at the venue, according to Dispatch. “Quite a lot of people at YG have noticed their relationship,” a source told Dispatch. “Jennie’s mother is also aware of her relationship with G-Dragon. She’s thankful that he takes special care of her.”</p><p>In response to the rumors, YG Entertainment released this statement: “We can not confirm anything about our artists’ personal lives. We ask for your understanding.”</p><p>In 2017, there was also a rumor that Jennie was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">dating producer Teddy Park of 1TYM</a>, who worked on BLACKPINK songs like “Boombayah,” “As If It’s Your Last,” “Playing With Fire” and “Whistle.” YG Entertainment, however, shut down the rumors at the time in a statement that read, “This is the first time we’ve heard about Teddy and Jennie’s dating rumor. The rumor about Teddy and Jennie’s dating rumor are not true. We’ll be taking legal actions against groundless rumors.”</p><p>There were also rumors in 2019 that <a href=# rel=noopener>Harry Styles and Jennie</a> had a romance after they followed each other on Instagram and Harry attended BLACKPINK’s concert in Los Angeles. Those rumors have since fizzled out, and fans have claimed that Harry and BLACKPINK are simply friends. In her early days, there were also rumors between <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Jennie and BIGBANG’s Taeyang</a> after he posted a photo of her on Instagram. YG Entertainment later denied the rumors and claimed that it was created by a hater of the company, who spread false information, according to Channel Korea. “Since the first day I entered YG Entertainment, Yang Hyun Suk sajangnim told me to always be careful of boys,” Jennie said in 2016.</p><h2>Lisa</h2><p>As the youngest member of BLACKPINK, Lisa has been shipped with many idols. However, those relationships have never gone beyond the imagination of fans. In a 2018 interview with Airrang Radio, Lisa surprised her members when she revealed that she <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">prefers older men</a>, which makes sense considering that she’s the youngest member of BLACKPINK. Other than that, there hasn’t been much information about Lisa’s dating life, which is likely because of YG Entertainment’s strict rules around its artists dating.</p><h2>Rosé</h2><p>On a past episode of Weekly Idol, Rosé revealed that her dream man is <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">someone nice, polite and can sing well</a>. Lisa reaffirmed Rosé’s type on an episode of JYP’s Party People, where she also revealed that her bandmate likes men who can play the guitar. Though not much is known about Rosé’s dating life, many fans believe that she’s single because of YG Entertainment’s dating rules. In a 2017 interview with Radio Star, Rosie explained that YG Entertainment is strict, though their rules are flexible if artists discuss them with executives.&nbsp;“I wasn’t allowed to get a driver’s license. However, exceptions can be made if you discuss it with the company. The restrictions are just there to tell you not to do any of those things secretly,” she said at the time.</p><h2>Jisoo</h2><p>In a 2016 interview, Jisoo explained how strict YG Entertainment and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Yang Hyun-Suk were about dating</a>. “The first time I met Yang-Hyun Suk, he asked me, ‘Do you happen to have a boyfriend right now?’ At the time, I was wearing a ring, and he even asked what that ring was,” she said. “I didn’t have a boyfriend, and It was just a ring.” Jisoo even explained that YG schedules its trainees to eat at different times so male and female trainees don’t spend too much time together. “Even the eating times of trainees are different. At YG’s cafeteria, if the boys eat at 6 o’clock, the girls will eat at 7 o’clock,” she said on 2017 episode of Radio Star.</p><p>As for her own romantic life, Jisoo has said that she’s never had a boyfriend or been in a relationship before, which is why there are no rumors about her dating anyone.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/entertainment-newsletter-banner.jpg alt="New Entertainment Newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ilpai2pHuQaW9xamhnfKO4wJyiqaGeoHqlrdOipaBlmJ7AtbvRsmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lopez-got-married-to-her-long-time-boyfriend-ben-affleck-in-las-vegas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Lopez Got Married To Her Long Time Boyfriend Ben Affleck In Las Vegas</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jaclyn-smith-age-136418.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jaclyn Smith's Beauty Secrets: How She Looks So Great at Age 77</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
