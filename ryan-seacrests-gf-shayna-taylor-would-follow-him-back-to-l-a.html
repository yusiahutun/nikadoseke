The source reveals Shayna would be happy to be with Ryan, “wherever he sets up his home base.”</p><p>“Clearly there’s a lot a stake,” the source continues. Since Ryan would need to be on the east coast to film <a href=#>Live With Kelly and Ryan</a>, he still has a lot to think about before making the big move.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/shaynateresetaylor_77053403_2680708348678566_737855407124245279_n.jpg><p>Thankfully, he won’t have to worry about how the relocation would affect his relationship. Ryan, 45, and Shayna, 28, have been an off-again, on-again couple since they first met in 2013. The pair share the TV personality’s luxurious Manhattan apartment and the model is OK with Ryan doing what’s best for him and his health.</p><p>The radio persona gave everyone&nbsp;a big scare when he <a href=#>skipped the May 18 episode of Live</a> due to exhaustion. “Ryan is <a href=#>adjusting to the new normal</a> and finding work-home balance, with the added stress of having to put on live shows from home,” his rep told <a href=#>People</a> at the time about the reason for his absence. “He has been juggling three to four on-air jobs over the last few weeks and he’s in need of rest.”</p><p>Since Ryan has been working from his L.A. home amid the coronavirus pandemic, it’s “had him thinking,” about giving up his NYC pad for good, another insider shared with Closer on June 4. “He has nothing against New York, but he feels that <a href=#>he was healthier</a> in L.A.,” the insider revealed. “Ryan would like to move back to Los Angeles permanently.”</p><p>Although it makes a lot of sense to him, his cohost <a href=#><strong>Kelly Ripa</strong></a> would “absolutely” be “upset” if he ever decides to relocate, the source explains. “It’s no secret that she’s had issues with past cohosts. She loves Ryan and doesn’t want to replace him.” However, Kelly, 49, knows filming Live from two different locations is “not” how the show works. In fact, they’re only <a href=#>filming from the Caribbean</a> and the City of Angels because of the pandemic, but once that’s over, everyone expects the show to go back to normal, and&nbsp;an additional source close to Ryan denies rumors that the TV host is looking for a change. “Ryan will return to set for Live! once production resumes in New York, after they’ve deemed it safe,” said the source.</p><p>“Ryan and Kelly’s chemistry works when they’re side-by-side,” the insider adds. “ABC wants two hosts in one room, but never say never.” Because Ryan and Kelly get along so well, the network could possibly make the TV personality’s new living situation work. It’s “doable,” the insider admitted, but it won’t be easy.</p><p>Whether Ryan decides to move or not, Shayna will always his back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46rsJqmXaiyoq%2FRnqqtq12cs26%2Fx5qwp5ldqa66uM6rZLCnpaGxbrLOpaOor12dtq55wZqapGWkpHqtecBo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./love-islands-antigoni-shares-sexy-27881937.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Love Island's Antigoni shares 'sexy' shower scene after being forced to wash outside</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./oblivious-men-reveal-cringe-worthy-times-did-not-realize-hitting-them-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Oblivious men reveal the cringe-worthy times they did not realize someone was hitting on them</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
