It's also been met with trepidation from some fans and players -- not least of which because the colorful courts and uniforms used during In-Season Tournament games have been roundly criticized.</p><p>But one superstar player has taken aim at the tournament's rules, specifically one of its tie-breaking procedures. <strong>Boston</strong>'s <strong>Jayson Tatum</strong> has expressed frustration with point differential as a key tiebreaker for teams who are tied in the group stage standings -- and the <a href=#>NBA</a> may have to take his criticism into account for future competitions.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>"The game was already over and guys were still trying to score"</h2><p><strong>Tatum</strong> on Sunday told reporters that he was frustrated not only by the result of Friday night's game against the <strong>Orlando Magic</strong> -- he was also frustrated that the <strong>Magic</strong> kept adding to their lead before wrapping up a 113-96 win.</p><p>"Last Friday, where the game was already over and the guys (were) still trying to score...it's all about respecting the game and respecting your opponents," Tatum said.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jayson Tatum spoke about the <a href=#>#NBA</a>s In-Season Tournament:</p><p>"The point differential thing, Im not the biggest fan of it ... last Friday where the game was already over and the guys still trying to score, you know, its all about respecting the game and respecting your opponents."... <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SyPqPTUNgC</a></p>? Celtics on CLNS (@CelticsCLNS) <a href=#>November 27, 2023</a><p>The <strong>NBA</strong>'s top two tiebreakers for the <strong>In-Season Tournament</strong> are head-to-head record and point differential, with margin of victory taking on a new-found importance. The <a href=#>Magic</a>'s 17-point win took their overall point differential to plus-22, and <strong>Orlando</strong>'s 3-1 record has it atop Group C. This means <strong>Boston</strong> -- with a point differential of zero -- must beat the <strong>Chicago Bulls</strong> by 23 points on Tuesday to finish first in the group, and the <strong>Celtics</strong> could quite possibly miss the knockout stage entirely if they don't blow out the <strong>Bulls</strong>.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Is a Tatum hot streak right around the corner?</h2><p>The good news for the <strong>Celtics</strong> is that <strong>Tatum</strong>, by his own admission, is feeling well again after battling a recent illness. Tatum said he "on the other side" of what sounded like a bad head cold -- and a succession of dominant games could follow.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jayson Tatum asked if hes feeling better after being sick: "Today was the first day I woke up and felt like I was getting back to myself. Still a little congested, but I think Im on the other side of it."</p>? Jared Weiss (@JaredWeissNBA) <a href=#>November 27, 2023</a><p>Even if the Celtics fall short in their chase for the <strong>NBA Cup</strong>, <strong>Boston</strong> still has the <strong>NBA</strong>'s best record at 13-4 -- a half-game better than the <strong>Minnesota Timberwolves</strong> in the <strong>Western Conference</strong>. Tatum -- who is sporting averages of 28 points and nine rebounds per game -- will hope to feast against <strong>Chicago</strong> before Friday's showdown with bitter rivals <strong>Philadelphia</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jpuYrKOVqa%2BiuMtopZuZX5e8tMDOp2ScnZyptqS%2Fjmtna2tfZn5wfpdobW5uZWaxdX3Ea25pbJVqhXeyl5trbm%2BUY7W1ucs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-coolidge-elf-cosmetics-super-bowl-commercial-2023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Coolidge Teams With e.l.f.
