Although she rose to fame as a celebrity spouse, there is more to her than meets the eye.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-19_04-38-04-fotor-202309194478-682x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Victoria_Chlebowski></span>Who Is Victoria Chlebowski?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Imperioli’s spouse was born in the Soviet Union era of Russia in 1966. Hence, she is 57 years old. Victoria Chlebowski is of white ethnicity and holds Russian-American nationality. In addition, she grew up with her mother, Raisa Chlebowski, and her stepfather, Ryszard Chlebowski.</p><p>However, her mom left Russia for Ukraine in 1976 because of anti-semitism.&nbsp;Although Chlebowski’s parents are Russian natives, they migrated to the United States of America, where she has spent most of her life.</p><p>After moving to the U.S., her mother worked in real estate in the late 2000s, and her stepfather, Ryszard, worked as a master artisan in paneling and molding. As a kid, Chlebowski grew up in a Jewish family and was a devout Christian.
