The purpose of human life is to pursue all four goals with the same commitment and to lead an existence that harmoniously integrates all four.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">For LGBT Indians, time to right a British-era wrong</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The sculptures and carvings on the walls of the 12th-century Khajuraho temple in central India explicitly depict couplings that employ every conceivable sexual position, whether heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual. Lesbians are shown in flagrante, but then they were recognised as swarinis in the 2nd-century text on love and eroticism, the Kama Sutra, which even recognises homosexual marriage as “a union of love and cohabitation, without the need for parental approval”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/20/87f3713c-b67c-11e8-89ab-e29b0678280a_1320x770_111912.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Indian legends cheerfully portray sexually ambiguous individuals and relationships. The mythological Bhagirathi was born of two queens who made love to each other when his father, the king, died. Varuna and Mitra were two gods depicted as a “same-sex couple” in ancient Indian scripture, always shown side-by-side. The religious text Shatapatha Brahmana mentions them as personifications of two half-moons implanting their seed in each other as the moon waxes and wanes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Indeed, homosexual sex is mentioned without embarrassment: homosexuals and the “third gender” were widely accepted identities. In the Valmiki Ramayana, female Rakshasis are mentioned who kiss women lying on the demon-king Ravana’s bed, on whose lips still linger the taste of their master.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Dependent visa case gives Hong Kong’s gay community reason to hope</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The popular scholar of Indian classical literature, Devdutt Pattanaik, has written of how Indian lore is full of tales where men turn into women and women into men. Several Puranas (sacred Sanskrit writings) tell tales of Lord Vishnu who, for various reasons, becomes a woman, Mohini, and seduces sages and demons whom the gods wish to defeat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even personifications of the planets embrace alternative notions of sexuality: thus, in his Navagraha Kriti set of songs, the great 19th-century Carnatic music composer Muthuswami Dikshitar describes Budh (the planet Mercury) as Napumsakam, or one who is not quite male or female, since, as the love child of his adulterous mother, Tara, goddess of the stars, he was cursed by her husband, Jupiter, to be neuter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/20/c3ce5fe6-b67c-11e8-89ab-e29b0678280a_1320x770_111912.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All this (and more) offer ample evidence that homosexual activities existed and were acknowledged in ancient India. They were accepted in the Dharmashastras, the ancient texts, as an inescapable feature of society, but that does not necessarily imply approval of homosexual conduct.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Kama Sutra mentions homosexuals but with disdain. The ancient lawbook Manusmriti prescribes stringent punishments for male and female homosexuals. But there are very few stories of such punishments actually being carried out; their existence was intended to discourage overt homosexual practice but not to persecute it, let alone to stamp it out, since it was part of human reality.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The same was true of transsexuals. India has long recognised as a feature of its society the transgender people known as hijra s, who consider themselves neither male nor female.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hijras have been organised for centuries into formal communities of males who see themselves as – and express themselves socially as – female, dress in women’s clothes, and are attracted to men.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Pink Dot: Singapore’s rare gem for LGBT community shines brighter</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Incongruously enough, they are often seen dancing at weddings, in exchange for generous rewards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But all this elicited imperial disapproval. The heyday of colonialism coincided with the peak of the repressive Victorian era, when hypocrisy about sex was at its peak – even piano legs had to be covered because they were, well, legs! Colonial powers, breathtakingly self-assured about the superiority of their ways, disrespected (indeed often condemned) the cultural values of the people they conquered, particularly when it related to sexual activity, and had no hesitation about imposing their “superior morality” on the “inferiors” they ruled.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Victorian Britain found “morbid sexual passion between members of the same sex” to be “unnatural” and imposed severe colonial laws punishing it. Inevitably such laws came to be seen as “right” and previous indulgent attitudes “wrong” in the very societies upon which they were imposed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Colonial laws not only exercised a powerful influence on subjugated people, but set the standard to which colonial subjects were expected to adhere to receive the approval of the imperial authorities. As a result, these colonial attitudes were internalised by the victims. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalised “unnatural” sex, was drafted by Lord Macaulay in 1839 and enacted by the British Government in 1861. Though the British left in 1947, it took India another seven decades to get rid of the prohibition. As columnist Gurcharan Das put it: “Tragically, the colonial brainwashing was so deep that this un-Indian imposition remained on our statute books for 71 years after the colonisers had left.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/09/20/7cac7be8-b67c-11e8-89ab-e29b0678280a_1320x770_111912.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Das points out that “India’s is the only civilisation to have elevated kama, or desire and pleasure, to a goal of life …. Dharma [reflects] our duty to others but … kama is a duty to ourselves. The extreme pleasure of sex is recompense for the loneliness of the human condition.” Ancient texts grapple with the nature and power of desire, some acknowledging it as the essence of life – the source of action, creation and procreation – while others like the Bhagavad Gita commend the pursuit of right action without desire for reward or personal pleasure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">India’s ancient Hindu civilisation was predicated on the idea not just of tolerance but of acceptance of difference. This is what made it both appropriate and paradoxical that the Supreme Court judgment on Section 377, written by Chief Justice Misra, cites the words “I am what I am. So, take me as I am.” (Appropriate since this is the foundational Hindu idea; paradoxical because the words are the German writer Johann Goethe’s, not an ancient Hindu philosopher’s). <span class="tw_sectioncolor css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1><span class="courier css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>■</span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2wuMitoJyrX5a%2FtbXCpZxoamFrgXOFmGiemrFdqLK5ecinm6KZXZ2utHnArKqupZWZeqK6wqKcp6xdpby0tdOipqdlopqupXnKmqSaZaOqwbOt</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-country-stars-dont-play-super-bowl-halftime.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>This Is Why Country Stars Don't Play the Super Bowl Halftime</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./plastic-surgeons-on-botox.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dermatologist and Plastic Surgeon Advice on When to Get Botox</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
