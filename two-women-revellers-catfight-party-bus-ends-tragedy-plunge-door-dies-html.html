their way back </span><span>from a country music concert </span><span>to Santa Cruz, California, when the doors accidentally opened and the tragic accident took place.</span></p><p><span>Natasha Noland, 25, died after plunging from the bus at around 11.50pm on Friday on </span><span>Highway 17, while a 20-year-old woman from Felton was injured.</span></p><p><span>Several of the 12 to 15 passengers on the Party Bus of Santa Cruz fled the scene, according to </span><a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#><span>Mercury News</span></a>,<span> and two others

If any passengers are under the legal drinking age, alcoholic beverages would be prohibited unless a designated chaperone aged 25 or older is on board. The bill is expected to go before the state Senate in August.</span><br></p><p><span>Had it been law already, 'it could have prevented what happened last night,' said assemblyman Jerry Hill, noting that the woman who was fighting Ms Noland was only 20.</span><br></p><p><span>He sponsored the bill after 19-year-old Burlingame resident Brett Studebaker was killed in another party bus-related accident in 2010.<br></span></p><p><span>Mr Studebaker died in a car crash on Highway 101 in San Mateo after he got behind the wheel following three hours drinking on a party bus. At the time of his accident, his blood alcohol level was 0.26, more than three times the legal limit. A passenger in his car suffered brain damage and broken bones.</span><br></p><p><span>Doug Studebaker, the teenager's father, said he was saddened by the news of Ms Noland's death and that it points to the need for regulation of the party bus industry.</span><br></p><p><span>'A lot of parents and people don't know the extent of the drinking that occurs and is actually encouraged on these party buses,' said Mr Studebaker. 'There are certain vendors that are very unethical and allow underage drinking - in fact make a business of it.'</span><br></p><p><span>Mr Hill added that part of the inspiration for his bill was a call he received from a San Carlos mother after her 15-year-old daughter emerged so drunk from a ride to San Francisco aboard a party bus that she had to be taken to the hospital.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/30/article-2180978-1449DE8C000005DC-546_634x409.jpg height=409 width=634 alt="Government concern: A bill is being drawn up to clamp down on drinking on party buses.
