"My family are all very creative. They are so funny, we all create the craziest stories and jokes – we had to make up our own games."</p><p id=eaug7IQ_DOKH data-wc=52>This early practice helped Luma with her other passion, which is acting. She’s currently&nbsp;studying for a degree in acting at the William Esper Studio for the performing arts located in midtown Manhattan, New York. The school specialises in the Sanford Meisner technique, which has an emphasis on 'the reality of doing'.&nbsp;</p><p id=eNKHl6xYa13x data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Angèle on touring with Dua Lipa and being hailed as a feminist role model" class=hm-link href=#>Angèle on touring with Dua Lipa and being hailed as a feminist role model</a></strong></p><p id=ep0dS_C0TWll data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Sarah Lysander on how she turned selfies into Instagram success" class=hm-link href=#>Sarah Lysander on how she turned selfies into Instagram success</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/85b997d54246-luma2-z.jpg><p id=eNhS16Lh0x4- data-wc=16><strong>Top, £2,710, Bodysuit, £375, Trousers, £770, all David Koma Single earring, £10,000, Bangle, £9,260, both Messika</strong></p><p id=ezXxs3bwk5ZO data-wc=70>She talks about acting being a really important part of her life. "It really is. Now I've found this passion for the craft. I apply it to all fields of importance, it has transformed my life – the teachings are incredible.&nbsp;The first thing we learn is how&nbsp;to really listen, which is an amazing concept because it changes you in a beautiful way. In life we don’t listen enough."</p><p id=ekWAxjROVKDT data-wc=56>Developing her skills from acting, Luma has also&nbsp;recently written, produced and starred in a short film that she is currently submitting to festivals. "Having always been a storyteller, I love writing – this complements my passion for acting. The film is really beautiful, it’s about a group of women who were very misunderstood in history."</p><p id=eZ3vTBewu5_C data-wc=41>Seizing every opportunity and having an eye on the future has always been a focus for Luma.
