"Not because of her, just because... life is great without reality television, too."</p><p>She continued, "So it's not like, 'Oh my god, poor Crystal!' She has a great family, and there's a lot of say for not doing [reality TV]. She's gonna be great."</p><a title=@amazonlive href=#>@amazonlive</a> @kylerichards18 reaction to <a title=crystalkungminkoff href=#>#crystalkungminkoff</a> news <a title=amazonlive href=#>#AmazonLive</a> <a title=rhobh href=#>#RHOBH</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Amazon Live" href=#>♬ original sound - Amazon Live</a><p>After three seasons on the Bravo show, Minkoff <a href=#><strong>announced her departure</strong></a> from the series, calling it "bittersweet."</p><p>"I just wanted to share the news that I will not be coming back to film season 14 of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills," Minkoff said in a video shared to her feed. "It's very bittersweet. Never did I think I would've been asked to do this show in a million years, let alone film it for three seasons. Every single year I was asked back, it was a blessing. It was an honor."</p><p>Minkoff was the first Asian American housewife on the show's history. In her video, she weighed in on the significance of that title.</p><p>"Being the first Asian American on Beverly Hills was a lot of weight on my shoulders that I have since just have really understood the magnitude of what that meant for people," she continued.</p><p>During her three seasons on the series, Minkoff was candid about her struggles with an eating disorder and navigating health issues with her father. She also opened up about familial spats, and showcased her sometimes-strained relationship with her brother on-screen.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"I just wanted to thank you guys for being such an incredible support for me," Minkoff added. "And I hope that I have been for you, sharing my story with my ED, sharing stories about my father and his Alzheimer's. I've heard so many incredible stories from you guys."</p><p>While she's leaving RHOBH, Minkoff hinted that her time on-screen may not be over.</p><p>"This is not goodbye, this is see you soon," she said, concluding her announcement. "I have some other things going on that I will be sharing with you soon that I'll still be able to connect with you because at the end of the day, that is been my biggest gift of filming. This show is connecting with so many of you with your beautiful stories."</p><p>As for her own future on the show, the RHOBH OG said nothing has been officially decided one way or the other.</p><p>"I haven't said anything yet," Richards shared. "I know there are reports online that I'm not coming back, or that I am coming back. That conversation is TBD."</p><p>All 13 seasons of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills are available to stream on Peacock.</p><a id=gallery-link-96cc1603-69e6-47a6-b3dd-e3f7546f8a6b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:96cc1603-69e6-47a6-b3dd-e3f7546f8a6b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:70f3b448-c580-421a-bc7f-d959a94be59f data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/27/4by3/2024/03/04/27afb37d5a7a438782dc55c53bd36d6f_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21manBfoMatsYyroJygkaextHnSqZyao6NivLbAjJ%2BmpaSfrLavs4ycqbKrpJa5brfUp55mpZmjuLCyxaxkq6Cfl7Vusdeiq2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./labour-rich-indonesia-send-100000-workers-ageing-japan-reap-benefits-demographic-dividend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Labour-rich Indonesia to send 100,000 workers to ageing Japan, reap benefits of demographic divid</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kanye-west-offered-julia-fox-boob-job.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kanye West Offered To Get Julia Fox Boob Job During Uno Game</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
