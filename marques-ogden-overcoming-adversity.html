The rise of digitization has not only given birth to new professions but has also revolutionized the impact of existing roles in fields such as entrepreneurship and personal development. As technology continues to disrupt the world, individuals are creating a meaningful impact through a diverse array of professions.</p><p>One such personality creating a meaningful impact is <strong>Marques Ogden</strong>, <strong>Founder of </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ogden Ventures, LLC</strong></a>. Marques is originally from Washington, DC, and resides in Fuquay Varina, North Carolina. With a compelling background as a national and international keynote speaker, business coach, business consultant, best-selling author, brand ambassador, and former NFL athlete, Marques has forged a path that resonates with individuals worldwide.</p><p>His influence extends beyond traditional boundaries, as he not only imparts wisdom through his various roles but also hosts the highly acclaimed podcast, “Get Authentic with Marques Ogden,” which ranks in the top 1% among the world’s most popular podcasts. Marques is also an owner of Grind Goods and showcases his entrepreneurial spirit and commitment. Let’s delve more into Marques’s journey, his insights, and how he continues to inspire and guide others toward their breakthroughs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>From Rock Bottom to the Top</h2><p>Marques Ogden’s journey began in 2013 when he faced a life-altering setback. Filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy led to losing everything he owned, driven by his inflated ego, prioritizing materialism over genuine connections and human values. His pursuit of money, fame, and notoriety had taken a toll on his relationships, causing him to lose valuable employees and face a financial crisis due to budget overruns on a project. A pivotal moment came when he worked as a custodian in downtown Raleigh, earning a mere $8.25 per hour. It was during this period that Marques had his epiphany, a moment he vividly recalls as his “rock bottom, spoiled milk moment,” when he found himself covered in foul-smelling garbage.&nbsp;</p><p>Marques Ogden’s wake-up call was in September 2013 when he resolved to make a difference in the lives of others through speaking and coaching. Over a decade, he honed his skills and expertise. Yet, the most challenging aspect of launching his venture was the initial start. It was a formidable task to convey his aspirations to speak, coach, and assist others when he had limited experience in these domains. It took Marques two and a half years to secure his first paid speaking engagement, which finally came to fruition in April 2016. Through mentorship, personal development, and learning to provide value to his clients, he transformed into a seasoned speaker and coach.</p><p>Throughout the last seven and a half years, Marques Ogden and his company have partnered with 55 Fortune 500 companies in the United States. Their work includes keynote speeches, coaching, consulting, and launching a successful podcast. Marques’s journey, though initiated by personal adversity, has become a story of resilience, reinvention, and a commitment to helping others succeed where he once faltered.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Source of Perseverance</h2><p>Marques Ogden’s motivation is deeply rooted in the belief that his journey and the challenges he had overcome could inspire others. With a background as a former athlete and a personal history marked by struggles, including addiction, alcoholism, and gambling issues, he brought a unique perspective to his endeavors in keynote speaking, coaching, consulting, and podcasting. Marques has tasted the heights of success, growing an eight-figure business, only to see it crumble due to bad decisions. Marques believes his experiences could resonate with people and provide them with the inspiration and tools they need to navigate their challenges and attain personal success.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ogden Ventures, LLC</h2><p>Ogden Ventures delivers inspirational keynote speeches to major corporations and organizations. It also offers coaching and consulting services to business professionals and high-level executives. Clients can engage with Ogden Ventures to leverage their expertise in sharing powerful life lessons on the global stage, effectively elevating their brand and fostering growth and success.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Signature Keynote Presentations</h2><p>Marques Ogden has a lineup of signature keynote presentations designed to motivate and educate audiences across diverse topics.</p><ul><li><strong>“The Ego Mistake: From Eight Figures To $8.25 Per Hour”</strong></li></ul><p>In this keynote, Marques Ogden recounts his journey from an NFL athlete to a custodian earning $8.25 an hour and eventually to a successful keynote speaker and business leader.

Marques Ogden is fortunate to have found favor among various industries and age groups as his offerings continue to make a meaningful impact.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Team-Building Success</h2><p>Marques inspires others to step out of their comfort zones. The foundation of his team-building journey was laid with the addition of his business partner, Dawn Wiener. Dawn, the internal manager, shares Marques’s vision, dedication, work ethic, and values. As their partnership deepened, they recognized the importance of building a team that shared their ethos.</p><p>The process of expanding their team began with the recruitment of a website and SEO specialist, a trademark and patent expert, a skilled videographer, a virtual assistant, an external manager, a proficient social media team, and a copywriter.</p><p>This team-building journey, initiated by Marques Ogden and Dawn in 2018, has culminated in a cohesive unit where everyone is aligned with the same vision. This alignment fosters a healthy and productive organizational culture, demonstrating Marques’s ability to forge a team with a unified vision and values.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Insights on Mindset across Generations</h2><p>Marques has observed a common need among both younger and older entrepreneurs: The pursuit of an unbreakable mindset. Regardless of age, people today are faced with a world marked by negativity and conflicts, from global events like the Russia-Ukraine war to the ongoing Israel-Palestine issue. The need for a resilient mindset resonates with a wide age range.</p><p>In his speaking engagements, Marques Ogden introduces a mindset framework encapsulated in an acronym: MINDSET.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Mentally Prepared:</strong> Be mentally prepared for challenges.</li><li><strong>Invested:</strong> Invest passion and commitment in your endeavors.</li><li><strong>Never-ending:</strong> Pursue your goals to the edge of the world.</li><li><strong>Determination:</strong> Let negativity bounce off without affecting your progress.</li><li><strong>Setting Targets:</strong> Set and achieve targets continually.</li><li><strong>Expand Horizons:</strong> Avoid complacency and continuously seek growth.</li><li><strong>Talents:</strong> Recognize and maximize your unique talents.</li></ul><p>Marques has found that people of all ages appreciate this perspective on mindset, as he delivers it through his keynote titled “The Ego Mistake: From 8 Figures to $8.25 per Hour.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Balancing Act</h2><p>Marques maintains a delicate balance between profitability, stability, and innovation. The core of his strategy involves seeking innovative ways to enhance and grow the business. This includes implementing different systems and programs to propel the brand forward. However, he also recognizes the importance of stability, which lies in the foundations that have brought his business success – keynote speaking, coaching, consulting, and podcasting. These aspects remain constants, performed at a high level.</p><p>Profitability is another key pillar of his business ethos. Marques Ogden emphasizes the significance of not just making money but also managing expenses and saving resources. He firmly believes in the value of financial stability, understanding that it’s easier to spend money than to make it. To ensure his business maintains financial resilience, he prioritizes profitability and builds up a rainy-day reserve account to provide liquidity when needed.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Impactful Coaching</h2><p>Marques has guided clients towards success, particularly in the realm of podcasting. One client, in particular, had struggled to take the first steps in launching a podcast. Despite having a great disposition and a valuable message to share, the client hesitated for several months. However, Marques Ogden believed in their potential and encouraged them to leave their comfort zone. In August of the same year, the client finally leaped and initiated their podcast journey. As a result, the podcast not only contributed to the growth of their brand but also attracted inbound clients.&nbsp;</p><p>Another client, pushed out of their comfort zone by Marques’s guidance, ventured into podcasting. Their journey commenced not long ago, yet they are already experiencing great success. What makes their experience even more profound is their genuine love and enthusiasm for what they do.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Winning Formula&nbsp;</h2><p>Marques’s strategy for ensuring his customers maintain a competitive edge is grounded in a continuous improvement formula. He implements the formula by&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Learning from the coach and team</li><li>Visualizing potential for improvement</li><li>Vocalizing his abilities to assist others</li><li>Actively engaging with the right people in the right vicinity&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Crucially, Marques Ogden places significant value on seeking advice and insights from his team, his coach, and the people in his life. He firmly believes that the experiences and knowledge others share are vital in shaping one’s path to success.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tech-Powered Outreach & Growth</h2><p>For Marques, harnessing the power of technology has been a pivotal strategy for expanding his outreach and generating more business. He understands the importance of leveraging various tech tools, including AI and CRM systems, to enhance customer engagement.</p><p>One notable avenue has been using podcasts, both through his podcast and as a guest. This approach enables Marques Ogden to consistently connect with his target audience, delivering value and conveying the right message effectively. According to him, technology has also provided the means to reach and impact a larger audience, facilitating the progression toward a thriving and more fulfilling brand.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Vision for Growth</h2><p>Marques’s vision for the future is centered on growth and innovation. He plans to expand their online presence to ensure their valuable information is accessible to a broader audience, including those who may not afford their high-ticket offerings. This strategic approach aligns with Marques’s commitment to making their teachings and insights available to a broader community.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Lesson from Sports</h2><p>Marques’s background as a former athlete has had a profound impact on his leadership style. He draws inspiration from one of his most influential coaches, Jack Del Rio, who coached Marques Ogden during his rookie season in the NFL with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Jack instilled a crucial lesson in Marques, emphasizing that great leaders are essentially their own CEOs.</p><p>This perspective requires leaders to exhibit dedication, a strong work ethic, and a commitment to their personal and team success. It also stresses the importance of being a stellar teammate and serving a cause greater than oneself, much like iconic figures such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa, Mahatma Gandhi, and the spirit of Christmas. Marques Ogden internalized this lesson as a 22-year-old rookie and has carried it throughout his career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Guiding Legacy</h2><p>Marques wants his legacy to be built on the mission to help others learn from his past failures and succeed in their journeys. He envisions himself as a mentor who imparts wisdom to prevent individuals from making catastrophic mistakes. By sharing his experiences and insights, he wants to guide others to avoid pitfalls like bankruptcy and significant losses. Marques Ogden is committed to equipping people with the knowledge they need to thrive, leaving a lasting impact as a mentor who fosters growth and prosperity in those he supports.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Advice to Young Entrepreneurs</h2><p>Drawing from his extensive <a href=#>entrepreneurial journey</a>, Marques Ogden imparts valuable advice to aspiring young entrepreneurs. He emphasizes the development of an unbreakable mindset, highlighting the non-linear nature of life and business. He understands that success is a journey marked by adversity and challenges, and having the resilience to persevere is crucial.</p><p>Marques shares a powerful quote by Aristotle, “In times of extreme darkness, focus on the light.” He emphasizes that individuals themselves are the light, and by cultivating confidence and strength in their abilities, they can blaze a trail to fulfillment and success.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Marques’s legacy is built on the mission to help others learn from his past failures and succeed in their journeys.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLqivtCunKxln5yxprqMqK2eqpOkuqq6xmaYna6Vp8CqwNg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meaning-of-i-luh-ya-papi-dj-khaled-remix-by-big-sean.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meaning of I Luh Ya Papi (dj Khaled Remix) by Big Sean</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gretchen-wilson-house.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Its Gretchen Wilsons House!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
