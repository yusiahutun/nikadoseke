Showing a fine eye for business, the former midfield star's £26million contract with LA Galaxy presented him a chance to own an MLS team in the future which was an opportunity he grabbed with the creation of<a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow> Inter Miami</a>.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>The Rock transforms into David Beckham at Halloween but fans unimpressed by Man Utd error</a></b></p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Lionel Messi's ex-Navy Seal bodyguard joins Inter Miami star on holiday</a></b></p><p>The mass amounts of money he's made through his playing days as well as business transactions following it has seen Beckham's net worth stack up to a reported figure of £372million, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.

He enjoyed a three-year stint as manager of the England Women's team before being appointed head coach at Beckham's Inter Miami.</p><p>Despite his friendship with his former team-mate, Neville was sacked earlier this year after poor form had Miami rooted at the bottom of the MLS Eastern Conference.
