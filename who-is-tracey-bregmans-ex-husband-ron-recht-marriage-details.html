I need a moment.”</span></p><p><span>While the </span><i><span>Bold and the Beautiful</span></i><span> alum expressed that she was unsure if she would get married again, she is still hopeful that true love is out there. “I don’t believe in love at first sight per se,” she added. “I am much too jaded for that. I do, however, believe in an instant connection.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6hlmah6tb7AnJyyZZKnsqi5wKeqZp2oYrW2v8GapZ1loqS7br7EnJ%2BtZZ2Wv7O1wKCcZpyVqa6quNJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wisteria-hysteria-beloved-plant-dubbed-symbol-oppression-colonial-conquest-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wisteria hysteria!
