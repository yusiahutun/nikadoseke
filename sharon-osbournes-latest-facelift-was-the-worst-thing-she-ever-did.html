The star felt she looked like a mummy with the amount of bandages she had on her face to help with the healing.</p><p>“That one put me off and it frightens me. I really f***ing pushed it with the last facelift, and I am now like, no more,” Sharon <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">admitted</a>. “Time is against me, I cannot have another facelift.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time that Sharon has opened up about what happened after the five-hour-long surgery she had. She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> The Sunday Times in 2022: “I had a full facelift done in October and I looked like one of those f—ing mummies that they wrap [with bandages]. It hurt like hell. You have no idea. One eye was different to the other. I looked like a f***ing Cyclops. I’m, like, ‘All I need is a hunchback.'”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Taylor Swift recreates old outfit with birthday look that must be a Midnights teaser</a></p><p>Upon seeing the results, she said the procedure hadn’t been worth the amount it cost. The X Factor Judge turned to the surgeon who performed it and asked: “‘You’ve got to be f***ing joking.'”</p><p>Even her rock star husband, <a href=#>Ozzy Osbourne,</a> was so horrified by what had transpired. He told her: “I don’t care how much it costs, we’ll get it redone.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-this-isn-t-the-first-time-sharon-has-said-she-will-stop>This isn’t the first time Sharon has said she will stop</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to</a> People, 11 years ago when hosting the TV show The Talk she said she was giving up making changes to her body such as her face and breasts, saying there would be “no more abuse.”</p><p>She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a>: “No more, because I have been looking at pictures of myself recently since I started to lose weight. And in a lot of shots, my face looks plastic and at certain angles I was like, ‘Oh, dear. Oh, I should never have done that. Oh, that’s a bad one.’ So I’m like, ‘No more. No more abuse.’”</p><p>She also said one of the implants in her breasts burst. “One of them had burst, and all of it had gone into the wall of my stomach. And one breast was different than the other.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-after-a-surgery-seven-years-later-she-couldn-t-feel-her-face>After a surgery seven years later, she couldn’t feel her face</h2><p>Despite saying she wouldn’t be going under the knife ever again, Sharon Osbourne had a facelift in 2019. While appearing on the <a href=#>TV</a> show The Talk she was still in “a little bit of pain” but “couldn’t complain” as she wanted to have it done.</p><p>“It was five weeks today that I had my operation. I had my neck done, my jowls … He kind of pulled it from the top of my head and put an elastic band in it. But everything was just lifted up. So it looks more refreshed. I feel okay. Still a little bit of pain. But you can’t complain when you wanted to do it.”</p><p>She couldn’t feel her mouth after having the operation, and told <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a> she “looked like Elvis.”</p><p>She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a>: “I had this thing where they lifted up my mouth and then for the first week I couldn’t feel my mouth. I can hardly feel my mouth now, to be honest with you,” Osbourne said. “I couldn’t find my mouth. It was numb and it was up on one side and I looked like Elvis.</p><p>“All the kids and Ozzy are going ‘Why are you snarling at me’ and I’m like ‘I’m not snarling. I’m not doing anything!'”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>7 times Robert Pattinson didn’t filter his unhinged thoughts over Twilight</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aFcL%2FHmqmopl2kwKO71Kulnqtdoa61sdKtZJ%2BZk5q5qrLTZq6aq12ptaZ51qiprKxdqbWqusZmqqGdXZrDpr6MnaCdZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tyronn-lue-wife-salary-contract-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tyronn Lue Wife, Parents, Contract, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeopardy-ken-jennings-second-chance-jessica-stephens-winner.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeopardy! contestant Jessica Stephens left speechless as she goes from never winning a game to Tourn</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
