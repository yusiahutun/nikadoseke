She was born on 14 March 1992, in Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania, USA. She caught the public’s attention after her appearances in reality television series 16 and Pregnant and Teen Mom 2.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Over the years, Kailyn has faced turmoil for raising the child amongst her exes and recently, on her Baby Mamas No Drama podcast, she said that she was done with it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She added,</span></p><p><span><strong>&nbsp;“You know what? [In] 2021, I’m not even f-king playing. I am done paying for attorneys. I have six attorneys. When I told you, I’m done paying f-king all of them, unless it’s related to my f-king businesses. I am done. I’m done! We [are] working this s-t out.”</strong></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;In a recent April 2021 interview with Kailyn, she said she had been trying to keep balance with her exes to the best of their ability.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Though Kailyn married the father of her second child, Lincoln, Javi Marroquin, in 2012, she refused to take on his last name or hyphenate it ever since she had been thinking of a name change.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;In her recent 2021 Coffee Convos podcast, she mentioned the details of the name change behind the scenes. She first had to receive the green light from MTV to make the switch. She further added that the series Teen Mom 2 were also on their way to change it to Kail and confirmed it was stating that her begging for the switch paid off. So, she has finally changed her name to Kail Lowry on the network.</span></p><p><span>In a recent 2021 Instagram Story video, Kail <a href=# rel=noopener>revealed</a> that she went for an<strong>&nbsp;“internal exam”</strong>&nbsp;since she had a hard time on her period. After her appointment with the doctors, she had an ultrasound test which stated that Lowry had been diagnosed with PCOS.</span></p><p><span>In another of her Instagram post with the caption,<strong>&nbsp;“it’s all jokes”</strong>, she poked at herself. At the start of the clip, she was facing away from the camera, and written over the top of the video was:&nbsp;<strong>“Yeah, I’m gonna go to dental school and own my own practice.”</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Next, she faced the lens, and <a href=# rel=noopener>the text read</a>:&nbsp;<strong>“Kail did not go to dental school. She got knocked up at 16. She has been divorced. And has 3 baby daddies.”</strong>&nbsp;She also explained how things had changed before when she used to get along with all her child from different fathers.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Kailyn Lowry Roller Coaster Relationship With Ex-Boyfriend Chris Lopez</strong></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kailyn Lowry, done with all the attorney cases and fights for children, had a change of heart to set her feelings aside and let her children have a good parenting environment. Her recent ex Chris Lopez recently revealed that they are finally starting to improve their co-parenting relationship nearly nine months after welcoming their youngest son, Romello Creed. The two had a long history of five years in their relationship before they split in January 2020.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In a 2021’s Baby Mamas No Drama podcast, Kailyn discussed the struggles of single-mom parenting with her friend Toni. After Toni opened up about her son Brandon’s father not reaching out for his son for parenting, Kailyn exclaimed that she would be in a daze if the son ever wanted to meet his dad.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And her friend jumped in, saying:<strong>&nbsp;“No, we call him the sperm donor.”</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Kailyn also confessed</a>, in speaking about her ex Chris Lopez, saying:<strong>&nbsp;“Yes, that’s what I call mine too,”</strong>&nbsp;she was a bit unhappy about her relationship with Chris.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Teen Mom 2 star sparked a hint of the possibility of her getting back together with Chris after all the turmoil they had over these few years. Being a reality TV star, most of her private life has been already gone on public, along with the on-and-off relationship with Chris.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In March 2021’s Instagram stories, she asked the fans if it was still good to give the relationship even after the couple have some public in-fighting. She went on:<strong>&nbsp;“If you can move on through public problems and all of that – how do you explain it to other friends, relatives, the public?”</strong>&nbsp;With all these posts, fans have speculated that Kailyn was in the thought of reconciling with her ex Chris Lopez.</span></p><p><span><strong>YOU MAY LIKE : <a href=# rel=noopener>All About 'Teen Mom 2' Star Chelsea DeBoer Married Life, Kids, Net Worth, Weight Loss & Family</a></strong></span></p><p><span>The two had drama fit to show on the screen of&nbsp;Teen Mom 2&nbsp;back in 2020. Chris claimed that all these on-purpose dramas were to get some ratings on the series.&nbsp;The Sun&nbsp;revealed of them having an on-and-off relationship with blaming one another ever since.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Lowry, for her part, went on a very long tirade after Lopez threatened her with legal action, all because MTV may have captured his face in the new season. Lawry even called her ex “ridiculous” for being mad about being on the show. Moreover, Lopez was called on to be in front of the camera despite his desire to want privacy.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On an episode of Baby Mamas No Drama back in October 2020, Kailyn claimed to have been “humiliated” after her ex Chris Lopez demanded a paternity test for one of their children. She was having a too hard time on herself after the painful experience and later on confirmed that even before Chris, her exes Jo and Javi didn’t ask her for a paternity test.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/celebs/kailyn-lowry-with-her-kids.jpg alt="kailyn lowry with her kids" width=650 height=650 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Kailyn Lowry with her four kids (©: Instagram/Kailyn Lowry)</strong></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, unable to answer anything to him, even knowing who the dad was, she still went for the test to face additional humiliation after the nurse giving the DNA test said to her, ‘So, you don’t know who the dad is?’ This left her humiliated inside as tears run down through her eyes.</span></p><p><span>During her TV debut on Season 2 of&nbsp;16 and Pregnant&nbsp;back in 2010, Kailyn was pregnant with her first and oldest son, Isaac.
