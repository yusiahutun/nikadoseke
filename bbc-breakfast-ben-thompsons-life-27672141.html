and the pair regularly share adorable updates into their personal lives online.</p><p>Ben celebrated their 10th anniversary together last year as he told media lawyer Andy: “Happy ten years @andyroche. Can’t believe you’ve put up with me for ten actual whole years. Love you."</p><p>The pair enjoyed an exotic holiday together earlier this year, and Ben took to Instagram with a sweet snap of him and Andy posing with their arms around each other, both looking dapper in button-up shirts and trousers with a stunning backdrop behind them.</p><p>They also shared a glimpse of their incredible swimming pool, and posed in a traditional Italian street packed with cafés as Ben teased: "Already eaten my bodyweight in pasta and cheese. Ciao Sicilia!"</p><p>The pair used to live out in the Middle East together when Ben worked as a Middle East correspondent for the BBC, but they moved back to London when his stint was over.</p><p>Andy has worked on a number of projects over the years, including the launch of streaming service Disney+.</p><h3>Family life and sad loss</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27666522.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_JS273886758.jpg><p>Away from his relationship, not too much is known about Ben’s family - though he has confirmed he has a sister, Melissa, and shared a sweet throwback snap of the pair riding a bike together as kids.</p><p>Ben has also shared pictures together with his parents as they commemorated the life of his grandmother, who sadly died last October.</p><p>Taking to Instagram to share a snap of the family taking a gentle stroll through the woods, he explained: “It was the funeral of my lovely Gran this week.</p><p>“We celebrated her life, remembered great stories and shared happy memories with family and friends. It also meant we got to spend proper, quality time together at home.”</p><h3>Gym snaps</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Away from his suit and tie for BBC Breakfast, Ben doesn’t shy away from revealing his muscular physique for the cameras.</p><p>Last year, he shared an incredible glimpse of an infinity pool, standing in it with the water lapping up to his waist in nothing but a pair of swim trunks as he looked out at the sunset.</p><p>Enjoying a break in Saadiyat Island, Ben’s ripped shoulders and trim waist were on full display to the camera as he teased fans in the caption: “G’mornin.”</p><p>In another show-stopping snap, Ben knelt on the floor of a gym surrounded by huge weights and treadmills, with his hugely muscular legs and biceps on display.</p><p>He wore a pair of grey cotton shorts that fell to his mid-thigh, adding a nearly sheer black tank top which left his bulging shoulders on full display.</p><p>Lounging back on his knees, Ben held up his phone for a mirror selfie with his hair styled in a quiff - looking as though all that weightlifting had cost him no effort at all.</p><p>Ben also has his very own gym at home, complete with a Peloton machine, weights rack and leg weights machine.</p><p>It appears he and Andy enjoy yoga, too, with a rolled-up mat visible in the background.</p><h3>Quitting job</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27671677.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_JS264843889.jpg><p>In December 2021, Ben announced that he would move on from BBC Breakfast after a decade in the job - and would only return for special weekend episodes.</p><p>In view of his 43,000 followers, Ben said: “I’m hanging up my @BBCBreakfast hard hat and hi-vis in the New Year, so here’s a little thread of some of my ten years on the road, getting access to some of the most interesting and amazing businesses, and taking you with us.</p><p>“Starting out was terrifying but I quickly learned that you’re in safe hands with the brilliant @BBCBreakfast team. We moved from Television Centre in London to MediaCity in Salford in 2012.</p><p>Ben added that he’d be switching back to BBC World as he continued: “We’ve travelled all over: factories, offices, farms, warehouses, depots, shops, restaurants, pubs, nightclubs, railway stations, airports, and lots and lots of rooftops.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27671674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_BEN2.jpg><p>"(And for those who often ask why we’re 'stuck outside', TV is about showing you stuff, otherwise it's radio).</p><p>"Thank you to everyone running a business, big or small, for letting us in, letting us poke around and ask questions. I’m in awe of how resilient and determined you are. You just crack on."</p><p>And the star also paid tribute to the crew behind the scenes, as he concluded: “Thank you to our little Business team on BBC Breakfast. They do all the hard work; planning, organising, fixing and producing the stories every day AND travel with us on the road.</p><p>"They make the early starts and long days much more bearable."</p><h3>‘Bullying’ row</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27671676.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS264843887.jpg><p>Things turned rather awkward during one episode of BBC Breakfast, as presenter Luxmy Gopal jokingly accused Ben of “bullying” weather presenter Ben Rich.</p><p>Ben announced the segment by saying: “Now it is 12 minutes past seven, and we are promised that things are looking a little brighter.</p><p>“If you think that summer is over, it is not Ben, that’s the case, isn’t it? Good morning.”</p><p>Ben Rich then accused him: “You’re just stealing my lines, Ben, aren’t you really, yes?” as Thompson apologised: “I’m sorry!”</p><p>As the report ended, Luxmy said: “Ben, thank you, and do you know what?</p><p>"So earlier, Ben - my Ben - here was bullying you about the fact that it was only one or two days of summer.</p><p>“And then, just before this forecast, he was stealing your weather lines, if you want to make a formal complaint, I’m happy to be your witness.</p><p>“One Ben against the other, I know which Ben I’m siding with,” Luxmy joked.</p><p>Determined to save face, Thompson said: “Ben, can I just ask, so that you can actually contribute rather than me stealing your lines, and all of this is because of what the high pressure is sticking around because the wind direction has changed?”</p><p><b>BBC Breakfast airs daily from 6am on BBC One.</b></p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><ul><li><b><u><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Click here to check out the latest BBC Breakfast news</a></u></b></li><li><b><u><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>BBC Breakfast's Carol Kirkwood clashes with co-star after 'looking sad' remark</a></u></b></li><li><b><u><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>BBC Breakfast's Jon Kay swipes at Carol Kirkwood as she 'did not check forecast'</a></u></b></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=27663873><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="BBC Breakfast's Naga Munchetty mocks Charlie Stayt as he talks 'Spanish sausage'" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=27663873><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27671671.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_BEN.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27663919.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_MAP_CHP_050822Naga_4499NagaJPG.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=27663873>BBC Breakfast's Naga Munchetty mocks Charlie Stayt as he talks 'Spanish sausage'</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=27662666><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|Image aria-label="Countdown fans beg for Les Dennis to replace Anne Robinson as host of Channel 4 show" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=27662666><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24912342.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_luxmiPNG.png></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27662635.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Countdown-fans-beg-for-Les-Dennis-to-be-given-full-time-host-job-as-he-presents-Channel-4-show.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=27662666>Countdown fans beg for Les Dennis to replace Anne Robinson as host of Channel 4 show</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZK%2Bjr4ybqZ6Zm5uutMCMm5ynZaSdvK680qilrGWcnrOmeZFwbXBqYWl%2B</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bernnadette-stanis-and-tom-fauntleroy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>BernNadette Stanis and Tom Fauntleroy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./440082-who-gugu-mbatha-raws-husband-relationship-dating-history.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Gugu Mbatha-Raw's husband?
