The clip has resurfaced after P Diddy’s home was raided by police – even though the two are not related.</strong></p><p>In January, the funnyman spoke to former <a href=#>NFL</a> tight end Shannon Sharpe on the Club Shay Shay podcast. Katt Williams spoke about his career, being ‘canceled’ and claimed there were deviants within <a href=#>Hollywood</a> and famous faces. He then went on to predict that 2024 would be the year when ‘they were exposed’. Fans are re-sharing his video after <a href=#>P Diddy</a>‘s home was raided by cops this week, as the <a href=#>music</a> star vehemently denies any allegations against him and protests his innocence.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-katt-williams-rant-on-hollywood-deviants>Katt Williams rant on Hollywood ‘deviants’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-531409073-1024x685.jpg><p>The reason Katt Williams’ rant came up is because he referenced P Diddy in his ‘deviants’ speech – as an example of his fame.</p><p>Katt claimed: “Race is not where the line is drawn.</p><p>“It’s God’s side and the other side, and we don’t care nothing about the other side, period. All of these big-d*** deviants is all catching hell in 2024. It’s up for all of ’em. It don’t matter if you Diddy or whoever you is … all lies will be exposed. That’s all, and anyone who takes that the wrong way, know why they take it the wrong way … the truth is the light.”</p><p>The comic was using Diddy as an example of status, as the producer is one of the most famous and successful in the industry. This comment was also made in January, more than two months before the star’s home was raided.</p><p>But Katt did hint he has been ‘keeping secrets’ about famous stars, in a strange confession.</p><p>He continued: “Because, in 30 years, I’ve done nothing but collect information, knowledge, and your secrets.</p><p>“So, if you and a man was in a corner doing something you wasn’t supposed to be doing … somebody come to tell me.”</p><p>He bragged he’s been finding things how he shouldn’t – but wouldn’t go into detail on what it was.</p><p>Katt said: “I gather that. I value that. I’ll pay for that. Come tell me. I know so many things I shouldn’t know, and they all know it … You don’t make me the villain, not the guy that raises Black children and ain’t never done a hard drug in his life, and don’t have no stories of doing nobody dirty, and they’ll just go out and lie, ‘The industry doesn’t mess with Katt because he didn’t show up for the studio.’ No studios have ever said that.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-katt-did-call-out-kevin-hart-and-ludacris-though>Katt did call out Kevin Hart and Ludacris though</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>👀 Katt Williams was telling the truth about Diddy</p><p>“All of these big d*ck deviants is all catching hell in 2024… it don’t matter if you’re Diddy or whoever it is… all lies will be exposed” <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/uuEESmRuQe</a></p>— James Jinnette (@james_jinnette1) <a href=#>March 26, 2024</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><p>During Katt’s rant on ‘deviants’, Williams did take aim at <a href=#>Kevin Hart</a> and Ludacris though, alleging the rapper was ‘offered deals by the Illuminati’ for fame, and the movie star was a studio ‘plant’.</p><p>He claimed: “[Hart] already had his deals when he got here! Have we heard of a comedian that came to LA, and, in his first year in LA, he had his own sitcom on network television, and had his own movie called ‘Soul Plane’ that he was leading? No, we’ve never heard of that before that person or since that person.</p><p>“What do you think a plant is? Maybe people don’t understand the definition of these words.”</p><p>Then for the rapper, he alleged he and Ludacris were offered deals by the Illuminati, including one cutting their hair and the other deal being $200m for 20 movies.</p><p>He said: “One of those people turned out to be Ludacris and the other person turned out to be Katt Williams”.</p><p>Both of the stars responded to the wild claims.</p><p>Hart wrote on <a href=#>Twitter</a>: “Gotta get that anger up outcha champ…. It’s honestly sad”. He then promoted his new film Lift at the time.</p><p>Whereas Ludacris chose to freestyle rap about Williams.</p><p>He said: “Never been Illuminati, only Ill-Luda-nati. And I only left with b*****s when coming from any party.</p><p>“Now I’m married with kids, the evolution of life. Never been a clout chaser, never say s**t for likes. RIP John Singleton, you never have to flex when you earned every one of your Fast and Furious checks. Afro with the sideburns, yeah, that’s my signature. Addiction’s on the rise, comedians check your temperature.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-video-resurfaces-as-p-diddy-s-homes-are-raided>Video resurfaces as P Diddy’s homes are raided</h2><p>The reason fans are re-sharing Katt Williams ‘deviants’ comments is because he mentioned P Diddy when talking about fame. It comes after the rapper – real name Sean Combs – had his homes raided by Homeland Security on Monday.</p><p>Two real estate properties owned by Diddy have been searched by federal agents as part of an ongoing sex trafficking investigation. Homes in Los Angeles and Miami were searched by officers in relation to a case in New York.</p><p>Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) said in a statement it “executed law enforcement actions as part of an ongoing investigation, with assistance from HSI Los Angeles, HSI Miami, and our local law enforcement partners.”</p><p>Aaron Dyer, Diddy’s attorney, released a <a href=# rel=nofollow>statement</a> after the homes were raided.</p><p>He said: “Yesterday, there was a gross overuse of military-level force as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs’ residences. There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated.”</p><p>“Despite media speculation, neither Mr. Combs nor any of his family members have been arrested nor has their ability to travel been restricted in any way,” Dyer added.</p><p>“This unprecedented ambush – paired with an advanced, coordinated media presence – leads to a premature rush to judgment of Mr. Combs and is nothing more than a witch hunt based on meritless accusations made in civil lawsuits.”</p><p>He said: “There has been no finding of criminal or civil liability with any of these allegations. Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name.”</p><p>Dyer explained Diddy was ‘never detained’ and ‘spoke to and cooperated with authorities’.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-diddy-has-called-the-allegations-sickening>Diddy has called the allegations ‘sickening’</h2><p>It comes after the 54-year-old has been subject to lawsuits in recent months, including a music producer filing a lawsuit.</p><p>Combs’ attorney said slammed those allegations, saying “we have overwhelming, indisputable proof that his claims are complete lies”.</p><p>A spokesperson previously said two previous lawsuits filed over sexual assault were “made up and not credible”. They branded them “purely a money grab and nothing more”.</p><p>He has denied all allegations.</p><p>He previously said in December: “Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth.”</p><p>Diddy also called the claims ‘sickening’ saying accusers were “looking for a quick payday”.</p><p><strong>If you have been affected by this story, you can contact the Rape Crisis team.
