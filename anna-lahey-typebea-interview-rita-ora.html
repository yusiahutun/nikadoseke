So whether your hair is straight, curly, coily, thin, thick, whether you have extensions or your hair is colour treated… it's an inclusive range, everyone can use it. Also, having really active ingredients makes a difference - a clinically studied dose of baicapilTM, for example, means we can make generous claims like ‘prevents hair loss by 60%’. They’re really clean formulations, too. Absolutely no parabens, no sulphates, no silicones. The other thing is that we've been able to create something really sensorial. It lathers well, feels good, smells good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/7ca26457ac6f-tbfullrange2.jpg><p id=eWMDnfByQH data-wc=6><strong>How do you use the products?</strong></p><p id=eH1Bd1dNch data-wc=155>My hair is oily so I wash it everyday. But just so you know, Rita shampoos her hair once or twice a week at the most. The Strength + Length Shampoo contains salicylic acid, which creates an optimal environment for your hair to grow, and we have a keratin, plant-based Strength + Length Conditioner. What I love about the Overnight Boosting Peptides serum is that it’s 100ml, so you can apply it liberally. It’s water-based, not oily. You can use it on blow-dried hair and it won’t make it sticky or greasy. You can use it before bed and there won’t be any residue on your pillowcase. Then once a week, I apply the Hydra-Gloss Treatment from my mid-lengths down. The great thing about this product is that it activates in three minutes. It contains a biomimetic ceramide that mimics natural hairs proteins to reduce split ends. This is probably one of Rita’s favourite products.</p><p id=e3NZkdBTvE data-wc=10><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Rita Ora's 'hydro-bob' is bang on trend for spring</a></strong></p><p id=eP48ijd56VE data-wc=12><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>7 TikTok beauty aesthetics that are set to dominate in 2024</a></p><p id=exlcbCujkG data-wc=12><strong>Did you always know that you wanted to start your own businesses?</strong></p><p id=efoVi3bihL data-wc=56>I think I always knew that I wanted to work for myself, or that I wanted to do something different.

I mean, we still make mistakes. It’s important for people to know that behind every success story there are failures. But my advice would always be to just start, take the first step. Because it's never going to be the perfect idea or the perfect plan, especially if this is your first business. I’ve evolved and the business has evolved with me. I’ve had to trust myself and the process. &nbsp;I’m taking so many learnings from Vida Glow into building Typebea.</p><figure class="HFMQuote_hd2j4x3 quoteClass_qcs0mq1 -category-beauty-trends -style-2"><p id=eaUVvOoGPNc>'The rising tide raises all boats.

There are so many that I have connected with. We text and send each other products, a few are messaging me today to say ‘congratulations’. Even if some of these founders have products that are competing with mine, the rising tide raises all boats.

When you meet a celebrity, you never know what you’re going to get but she was such a delight. We sat next to each other at lunch and exchanged numbers. Rita was interested in the business and my story. And because the idea for Vida Glow was rooted in my own hair loss journey, we really connected. As a popstar, Rita’s hair has seen different colours, types of up-do, extensions, it’s been peroxide blonde. We had a lightbulb moment while sharing our experiences.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ab04ca8ce668-snapinstaapp43910890638336906468529773026884896885743n1080.jpg><p id=eSVF7S_oyK data-wc=7><strong>What makes Rita a good business partner?</strong></p><p id=ergZ5aA-Xh data-wc=61>She is really generous with her time and has an incredible work ethic. She joins me for retail pitches and speaks directly to the buyers - who are definitely not expecting her to turn up. &nbsp;She works with the creative team. She's really opinionated about the formulations and passionate about the campaign look and feel. She's refreshing. A really good person.</p><p id=egVjqIvq48 data-wc=6><strong>How do you coordinate your schedules?</strong></p><p id=et6ZB8SFmP data-wc=86>It's wild, I'm not going to lie. But when we’re not together, we text pretty much every day, Facetime when we need to. Rita also loves a voice note. We make it work. I'm used to running a global business and traveling a lot. Plus our retailers and the media are all on different time zones, so that's my reality. But how Rita spends that much time overseas, dealing with jetlag, then gets up on stage to perform and then goes to meetings.. She gives everything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7814ad4b8d31-snapinstaapp32903929915377176067145182568218773447288702n1080.jpg><p id=e6kWFfA7_c data-wc=8><strong>How do you figure out a life-work balance?</strong></p><p id=e0L6_-30qY data-wc=106>I do the best that I can with what I have. I love being a mum but I also love working. It's a lot of sacrifice but I can do it because I have the support of my family. My mum and dad live round the corner and move in when I go away, so the children have the consistency of my family. And then we have a wonderful nanny for support, that's the only way I can do this. And I like to be honest about that, because no one's superwoman. I don’t call it the juggle though, that's what clowns do. Women move mountains.</p><p id=eLMwHSE14- data-wc=11><strong>What do you like to do when you stay in London?</strong></p><p id=eszChSryYS data-wc=86>I'm quite the Anglophile, I love the stiff upper lip and the Englishness of everything here. I browse Harrods, Selfridges and Liberty. When I bring my kids, we go to Hamleys. I always stay at Claridge’s, the service is amazing. I often eat at The Twenty Two or Daphne's. Last time I was in London, Rita and I had lots of pub dinners together. She introduced me to some of her local places and we went to The Cow in Notting Hill, which was really great.</p><p id=eh_wzHwOon data-wc=8><strong>What are your predictions for the wellness category?</strong></p><p id=e-tXUJr25y data-wc=70>The ‘skinification’ of haircare, people are realising that healthy hair needs more than just a shampoo and conditioner.
