I will always fight for relationships. I’ve been that way since I was little, although I was shy and sometimes very closed off. I don’t give up on anything.

I met her at some restaurant, while I was eating with my parents and my brothers. We started talking and from there, we continued to see each other.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bunny and Berlingeri's relationship intensified at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the couple quarantining together. “Do people really think I’m spending quarantine alone?” the rapper later told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bad-bunny-cover-story-lockdown-puerto-rico-new-albums-996871/? data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Rolling Stone</a>. “No!

The following year, they made their red-carpet debut for the Billboard Latin Music Awards.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the summer of 2020, rumors of an engagement began to swirl after photos of Berlingeri wearing a diamond ring spread like wildfire across the Internet—but Bunny shut down the rumors with a frank response to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.etonline.com/bad-bunny-sets-the-record-straight-on-marriage-rumors-exclusive-156962 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Tonight" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Entertainment Tonight</a>. “No, I'm not that married,” he said. “Maybe it can be [an engagement]. But I think that weddings and get[ting] married scare me.

Their romance got serious enough that Bunny proposed to De La Cruz in 2016, though they ultimately called off the relationship in 2017.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In March 2023, years after their breakup, De La Cruz sued the rapper for at least $40 million over his use of a voice recording that she provided him prior to his rise to fame. De La Cruz can be heard saying “Bad Bunny, baby” in two of the artist’s songs, “Pa Ti” and “Dos Mil 16.” The lawsuit claims that De La Cruz’s recording has also been used without her consent in various records, promotional activity, concerts, television, radio, and social media platforms, according to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://apnews.com/article/bad-bunny-lawsuit-baby-girlfriend-ac0d0cadcc8bf8b6553432365234aeae data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Associated Press" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Associated Press</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The lawsuit, which also sues Bunny’s manager Noah Kamil Assad Byrne, states: “Thousands of people have commented directly on Carliz’s social media networks, as well as every time she goes to a public place, about the ‘Bad Bunny, baby.’ This has caused, and currently causes, that De La Cruz feels worried, anguished, intimidated, overwhelmed and anxious.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The filing alleges that a rep for Bunny reached out to De La Cruz in 2022 in order to sell the recording of her voice to her for $2,000, an offer that she ultimately declined.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
