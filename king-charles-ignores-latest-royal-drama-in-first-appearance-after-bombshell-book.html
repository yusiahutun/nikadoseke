When asked how he was, the 75-year-old cracked a joke about his recent birthday. He said: “I’m all right very much… just about. Having had a rather ancient birthday recently, recovering from the shock of that.”</p><p>The King’s chat with the Nigerian president is the first of many meetings with leaders from around the globe, as the <a href=#>royal</a> is in Dubai on a two-day trip for Cop 28. He has met with students to discuss advancements in technology, and tomorrow will deliver the opening address at this year’s event. He previously did so when he was the Prince of Wales at Cop 26.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-publication-error-for-scobie-s-book>Publication error for Scobie’s book</h2><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>Meghan Markle could be as ‘big as Martha Stewart’ away from Harry, author says</a></strong></p><p>The royal book’s publication could be what caused King Charles’ hesitant response.</p><p>When it was published, early reviews of the Dutch version <a href=#>allegedly named two people who had discussions</a> about Harry’s eldest, Archie, and his skin color. The alleged conversation and remarks were mentioned by Harry and <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> in their 2021 tell-all interview with <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a>, although Harry, 39, said he would never name the people who had the discussion.</p><p>At the time, when asked about it directly, Prince William said that the royal family were “very much not a racist family.”</p><p>A statement from Buckingham Palace, which was published on behalf of <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth</a>, read: “The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.”</p><p>The book was soon pulled from shelves and, in an interview with Dutch chat show RTL Boulevard, Scobie said that he had nothing to do with the Dutch printing, having only written and edited the English version as he “doesn’t speak Dutch.”</p><p>“The book is in several languages, and unfortunately I do not speak Dutch. But if there are translation errors, I’m sure the publishers will have it under control.”</p><p>He added that there had “never been no version that I’ve produced that has names in it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-charles-could-abdicate-within-the-next-few-years>King Charles ‘could abdicate’ within the next few years</h2><p>A royal columnist and biographer, Clive Irving, believes that the King <a href=#>could abdicate “when he’s 80.’</a></p><p>“It may have already been surreptitiously planned that the King will abdicate when he’s 80,” Irving said. He claimed that the King could stay on the throne for a few more years to see The Firm through a “difficult transitional phase” which came after Harry and Meghan stepped down from their royal duties in 2020 and his mother’s death last year.</p><p>“He [Charles] wants to just have his moment in the limelight for a few years,” Irving explained.</p><p>“Make sure that William and Harry are carried through what’s going to be an incredibly difficult transitional phase for the monarchy.’</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Prince William is ‘sick of dealing with Harry and Meghan drama’, source claims</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2V%2BcLfIp55mm5iWv62x0magoKafp7K0ecuaq56rpGK%2FsMXApWSdqpGirm61zWadoqqjqXqivM%2BemKuZnpiybq3FrZyrZZKkuqO%2Fx56jpWWSpLysew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lionel-messi-sends-autographed-jerseys-his-little-afghan-fan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lionel Messi sends autographed jerseys to his little Afghan fan</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jacob-limberios-death-ruled-accident-witnesses-failed-dr-phil-lie-detector-test-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jacob Limberios death ruled an accident though witnesses failed Dr Phil lie detector test</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
