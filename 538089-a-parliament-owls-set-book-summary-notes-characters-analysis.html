The <a href=#>popular set book</a> satirises poor leadership, tribalism, and corruption, showing how they hinder societal progress. It also demonstrates that marginalised individuals, like Oyundi the Fire-finch, can spark change peacefully.</p><p class=align-left>Importantly, it encourages youths and Kenyans to engage in civic awareness and drive positive change. There are several themes arising from the play, such as:</p><h3 id=538089-1-corruption-and-abuse-of-power-dictatorship class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>1. Corruption and abuse of power (dictatorship)</h3><p class=align-left>The play depicts a society where corruption runs rampant, particularly within the Parliament of Owls. Characters like Money Bags Owl exploit their positions for personal gain, grabbing territory and sponsoring frivolous bills. This theme highlights the negative consequences of unchecked power and greed.</p><p class=align-left>Power is also abused when the leaders in the book use dictatorship to get what they need from the commoners. Commoners feel insecure about their future and safety, knowing they are at the mercy of the owl-dominated Parliament of Owls.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5af06946c4e92bdd.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Martha Karua, Pinky Ghelani Lead Women at Empowering 'The Purple Colour' Movie Premiere</span></p></a><h3 id=538089-2-love class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>2. Love</h3><p class=align-left>The author of this book tackles the theme of love from all angles, whereby there is a twist of laughter, lies and illusion. Throughout the story, there is a sense of companionship and solidarity among the rebel birds and their supporters. Some characters, like Iron Lady Owl and Oyundi the Fire-finch, demonstrate a deep love for justice and fairness.</p><p class=align-left>Love is also explored through themes of conflict and betrayal. The corrupt actions of characters like Money Bags Owl and Socialite Owl reveal a betrayal of trust and a lack of love for their fellow birds.</p><h3 id=538089-3-favoritism class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>3. Favoritism</h3><p class=align-left>This theme is evident in the kingdom's unequal treatment of different<a href=#> bird species</a>. Those in power like Money Bags Owl and Socialite Owl, show favouritism towards their kind, passing laws and making decisions that benefit owls at the expense of other birds.</p><h3 id=538089-4-oppression-and-rebellion class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>4. Oppression and rebellion</h3><p class=align-left>Oppression is a central theme, as the corrupt governance of the owls suppresses dissenting voices and exploits other bird species. However, this oppression sparks rebellion among the oppressed, led by characters like Iron Lady Owl and supported by a coalition of birds seeking change. The narrative explores the dynamics of resistance against unjust authority.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9407d701b090c984.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fellow Kenyans, It's Us Again: Ruto, Raila Set Pace for 2027 Faceoff</span></p></a><h3 id=538089-5-political-satire-and-critique class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>5. Political satire and critique</h3><p class=align-left>The play critiques real-world political systems through its satirical lens, highlighting issues such as bad governance, tribalism, and corruption. By exaggerating and parodying these issues, the narrative encourages reflection and discussion on governance and leadership.</p><h3 id=538089-6-equality class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>6. Equality</h3><p class=align-left>A contrasting theme emerges through the rebellion led by characters like Oyundi the Fire-finch, who advocates for a more inclusive government. The narrative champions equality and inclusivity, suggesting that all birds should have a voice in governance, regardless of species or status.
