But when Zhang Huan addresses similar iconography, he creates paintings in a style all their own. Sitting in his Shanghai studio one day recently amid dozens of Tibetan death masks, he was busy preparing for the recent opening of "Poppy Fields", an exhibition of new works at the Pace Gallery in New York.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Poppy Fields" is a fresh direction for an artist whose studio is much like a factory, with more than 100 assistants churning out copper sculptures of Buddhas, paintings made of ash collected at temples, doors carved with scenes from the Cultural Revolution, stainless steel pandas, stuffed cows and horses and, on one occasion, a version of a Handel opera. His notion is that he can produce anything he imagines without regard for consistency.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Unlike Western masters, who will stick with one style their entire life until they reach maturity, I am in a constant state of transformation," Zhang says. "I am constantly abandoning old things for new ones, but there is always a thread behind these changes, and that is my DNA."</p><a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/2013/09/27/53c458b89e36c85bf57e153249864ab0.jpg></span></a>His latest transformation may be the biggest one to date: turning himself into an oil painter with a keen sense of colour after a career that has so far been mostly black, white and grey. The "Poppy Fields" works are a striking departure, for example, from those shown in a retrospective at Asia Society in 2007, two years after he returned to China after almost a decade in New York.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the new paintings, the canvas surface is covered with hundreds of skulls modelled after Tibetan masks that look like grinning faces with bulging eyes and Cheshire cat smiles. From a distance, the canvases blur into misty fields of colour, in white, pink and blue in one instance and black, red and gold in another. Yet up close, you can see each face in the crowd, as if you're zooming into a packed stadium from outer space.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"The paintings represent the hallucination of happiness and the hallucination of fear and loneliness in this life as well as the hallucination of happiness in the next life," Zhang says. Asked about his bright hues, he says:"If there's no colour in your hallucination, it won't be heaven. It would be hell."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Buddhism and death rituals have been abiding subjects for Zhang, who was ordained as a Buddhist monk eight years ago. During the anti-religious oppression of the Cultural Revolution, Zhang, born in 1965, remembers watching his grandmother go to the temple and burn incense before a statue of a Buddha. As an adult, he went regularly to temples; even after moving to New York in 1998, he studied every weekend with a monk in Queens, and later donated statues to the Chuang Yen Monastery, designed by I.M. Pei, in New York.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In her catalogue essay for "Altered States", the 2007 retrospective at Asia Society, Melissa Chiu, the museum's director, wrote:"Zhang Huan's works from the past 15 years reflect one artist's search for an artistic voice, first in Beijing, then in New York and finally in Shanghai."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chiu added that Zhang has placed "a progressive emphasis on Chinese sources with which he finds great inspiration in the shared memory of symbols, stories and materials of his homeland". Yet it is his embrace of Tibetan Buddhism that distinguishes him from other contemporary Chinese artists.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2005, a trip to Tibet altered Zhang's thinking and his art. "One day in Lhasa, I got up at 4am and went to the Jokhang Temple, the biggest one in Tibet, and I saw men and women already lining up for miles," Zhang says. He was amazed by the sight of pilgrims crawling to the site in the middle of traffic, in a seeming clash between modernity and ancient tradition.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I have been to the most famous museums in the world, and I have never seen a sight as striking as this," he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also witnessed a Tibetan sky burial, in which a monk eviscerates the human corpse, leaving the flesh as food for vultures, and smashing the bones into a grainy dust. The process is supposed to liberate the spirit from the body for peaceful transport into the next life.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Most people, when they see this ceremony, think it is gross and they cannot bear to watch," the artist says. "But when I watch the ceremony, I feel this hallucination of happiness, and I feel free." Zhang promises that at his death, the ritual will constitute his last performance piece.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Artist sees a death mask behind every human illusion</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHJ%2FkHJoaW5foq60t4ybnKGhnpl6psLEq7BmoKWirq95yKWjrquZpLs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./black-veil-brides.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Black Veil Brides and Ville Valo Announce Co-Headlining Tour of North America</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./39th-jaycees-wedding-expo-in-davenport-helps-couples-vendors-connect.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>39th Jaycees Wedding Expo in Davenport helps couples, vendors connect</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
