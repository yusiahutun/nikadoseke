The country star couple announced Katelyn's pregnancy via a holiday-themed social media post on Christmas Day (Dec. 25.)</p><p>The Browns are already parents to two daughters -- four-year-old Kingsley Rose and almost-two-year-old Kodi Jane -- and they incorporated both their girls into their pregnancy announcement. In the Christmas-themed photo, the family cuddles up on a coach, their decorated tree in the background, as Kingsley holds up a sonogram image of their soon-to-be baby sibling.</p><p>"Last Christmas of 4," Brown wrote in the caption. "Merry Christmas everyone!!" He didn't reveal any more details about the new baby, like their sex or due date, in his message. He also didn't share the name, although in keeping with their family tradition, it's a pretty likely bet that the name Brown and Katelyn select will begin with a "K."</p><p>Fans might be surprised that the Brown family are announcing their pregnancy now, since when they welcomed Kodi into the world in late 2021, they didn't share the news until after she was born. Katelyn later <a href=#>explained that she decided</a> to keep her pregnancy with Kodi quiet in order to make the experience more "intimate," and to soak up the process without influence from social media or the outside world.</p><p>Of course, hiding a growing baby bump is no small task, and both she and Brown admitted to having to pull off some fancy footwork and strategic angles in order to keep their secret from slipping out.</p><p>The Browns have been married since 2018, and over the past couple of years, they've spent substantial time together both onstage and off. They put out a duet called "Thank God" in 2022, and the song quickly became a No. 1 country hit, earning them both critical and commercial recognition as well as performance slots together both on Brown's tours and on awards shows and other televised events.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>20 Kane Brown Songs Every Fan Has Memorized</h2><p>Kane Brown has built himself quite the career: He's come a long way since 2015, when he released his first single, "Used to Love You Sober." Prior to that, Brown was covering other country stars' songs for social media. Now, he is a star, with nine No. 1 hits under his belt, including a special duet with his wife Katelyn. There's no ceiling to this Tennessee boy's success!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJmemnqjvs6wpWavmZuybrfArZylsZ5ir6Ku2GalqGVjZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lilly-bell-actor-wiki-age-biography-boyfriend-weight-height-videos-and-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lilly Bell (Actor) Wiki, Age, Biography, Boyfriend, Weight, Height, Videos and More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./clifford-the-big-red-dog-live-on-stage-features-beloved-canine-character-in-new-musical-theatrical-adventure.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Clifford The Big Red Dog LIVE On Stage Features Beloved Canine Character In New Musical Theatric</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
