That is exactly what has happened to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tony Danza</strong></a>, who reveals that being a grandad can sometimes be pretty frightening.</p><p>The actor — who attended and celebrated Patsy’s Italian Restaurant 75th anniversary with a special diamond gala on Monday, September 23 — talked about what it is like being a granddad. “No, grandfatherhood! Yes, I’m beyond father,” the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who’s the Boss</a> star, 68, exclusively told Closer Weekly&nbsp;when asked if his focus was fatherhood at the moment. In fact, he’s actually doing some babysitting these days.</p><p>“That’s a big part of it. It’s very profound to watch your son father his sons, especially when he’s so much better at it than you were. It’s really scary!” Tony explained. “I said to him, ‘You know what the difference is between you and me as a father? See how you take your kids to play baseball? I used to take you to watch me play baseball.’ And at the end of the game I’d say ‘how did I do?'”</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taxi</a>&nbsp;alum has two young grandsons — Lucas and Nicholas — thanks to his only son, Marc. “I want to be the guy who takes my grandson fishing and the guy he wants to go fishing with,” Tony once told Grandparents.com. As for Marc, the star couldn’t be more proud of how he is with his own children.</p><p>“I have even more respect for him,” Tony explained to the outlet. “The way he conducts himself with his kid makes me so proud. And I was proud of him before Nicky was born. I love them together. Just the other day they were playing Steamroller on the bed. Nicky was jumping over Marc as he rolled around. It was fabulous. I’m so fortunate to live close.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tony-Danza-talks-being-granddad-2.jpg><p>It is so great to hear that Tony is loving life with both of his grandkids, and nothing will change that at all anytime soon.</p><p><strong>For more on your favorite celebs, pick up the latest issue of Closer Weekly, on newsstands now — and be sure to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sign up for our newsletter</a> for more exclusive news!</strong></p><h5>Reporting by Diana Cooper.</h5><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tpqexXZmur8bAZqqasaNitrW%2FjKucmqScrnq0r8CrsGaalZ67qHnAZp6rmZ6Zs6LAx56paA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./firenze-musei-visitare-almeno-una-volta-vita.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Firenze e i musei da visitare almeno una volta nella vita</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./muscatine-high-student-designs-welds-hose-drying-rack-for-fire-dept.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Muscatine High student designs, welds, hose-drying rack for fire dept.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
