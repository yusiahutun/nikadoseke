Rigney, called by all who know her as SeeSee, is now 91 and the oldest working nurse in America.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two days a week, Rigney drives from her Tacoma home to the hospital for her 8-hour shift as an operating room surgical nurse.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Much of that time, she’s on her feet setting up equipment, readying operating rooms for a dozen surgeries in a day and helping patients onto the surgical table. The Fitbit Rigney wears on her uniform shows she usually wracks up two or three miles worth of steps each shift.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I kid and say it’s my Polish heritage,” Rigney tells PEOPLE. “I like to keep busy, I am a hard worker, I don’t like to sit and do nothing.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She once tried, when she retired at 65. That lasted six months.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I had these thoughts I would go back to work a day or two to get extra pocket money,” she says, “and here it is 25 years later.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Florence Rigney</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rigney remembers always wanting to be a nurse. Her father tried to dissuade her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He thought I should become a secretary because they made more money,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">August marked 70 years that she’s been in nursing. “I love what I do, I love nursing, I just wish I could do more,” she says.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Florence Rigney</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rigney had to give up golfing and cross-country skiing a few years ago. She’s outlived two husbands and one of her two children, an adopted son who died a decade ago in his 40s.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I eat healthy, I never smoked,” Rigney says. “I have a glass of wine occasionally.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What age does she feel inside? “Some days I feel 60 years old,” Rigney says, “and other days I feel like I’m probably 191.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swanson, 64, admires Rigney’s indomitable spirit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She is a go-getter, she is always busy, she can’t stand down time,” Swanson says. “She is as sharp as a tack and keeps up with people who are one quarter of her age, she truly is one of a kind in the nursing world.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Rigney turned 91 on May 8, a nurse from Muncie, Indiana, called her at work to share the news that she was 90. “She said, ‘We are the two oldest working nurses in the country’ and I said, ‘I have a year up on you,’ ” says Rigney, laughing.</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Need a little inspiration? <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Click here</a> to subscribe to the Daily Smile Newsletter for uplifting, feel-good stories that brighten up your inbox.</strong></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Upon turning 90, the hospital threw Rigney a big surprise party. A co-worker filmed the celebration and put it on Facebook.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I don’t do Facebook and one of my granddaughters said, ‘Grandma, it’s gone viral,’ ” says Rigney. “I’ve heard from people all over the world. They congratulate me and admire the fact that I still work.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s also admirable Tacoma General fully supports Rigney’s ongoing employment, which includes meeting nursing license requirements and taking computer classes to keep up with changing technology.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When you take a person like SeeSee, with all her experience, we wouldn’t dream of turning away a skilled, perioperative nurse,” Swanson says, “especially when they have the competency to perform.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But Rigney does see an end to her nursing days. She plans on working until her next birthday. When she turns 92.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Rigney doesn’t expect to slow down. “I’ll have to volunteer or do something,” she says. “I can’t do nothing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iquqK6jKKlrZ2imsC1e86lm56rpGLEsL7KoqWgZZ6qv7SxjJqknqqZmK5ussuoqZ6mk5p6s7XGp5yyZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pioneer-woman-ree-drummond-moved-houses.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ree Drummond Has Moved Out of the House Husband Ladd Grew Up In</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./malaika-arora-breaks-silence-on-her-wedding-plans-amid-relationship-with-arjun-kapoor-heres-what-she-says-1296535.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Malaika Arora breaks silence on her wedding plans amid relationship with Arjun Kapoor</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
