When he wasn’t spending his time on a film set, the Shining alum was being the best dad to his five kids, Jennifer, Caleb, Honey, Lorraine and Ray.</p><p>The <a href=#>Oscar</a> winner is a father of his children with four different women. Jack experienced parenthood or the first time during his marriage with <a href=#><strong>Sandra Knight</strong></a>, who gave birth to their daughter, Jennifer, in 1963. The former couple, however, split after six years of marriage in 1968.</p><p>Following their divorce, the One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest actor expanded his family with actress <strong>Susan Anspach</strong>. The two became the parents of Caleb in 1970, but they split before ever getting to tie the knot.</p><p>More than a decade later, though, Jack became a dad of three after he started dating model <strong>Winnie Hollman</strong>. The exes’ daughter, Honey, was born in 1981, but their relationship didn’t last as he fathered his fourth child, Lorraine, with <strong>Rebecca Broussard</strong> in 1990. The former pair also welcomed Jack’s youngest, Ray, in 1992.</p><p>Throughout the years, Jack’s kiddos have joined their famous father on plenty of red carpets. Though fans have seen tons of sweet glimpses inside his life as a dad of five, the As Good As It Gets alum is actually fairly private when it comes to his family. Fortunately, he’ll open up about his role as a dad every now and then.</p><p>“It’s a divided parenthood, with their wonderful [mothers] and myself. We’ve always gotten along. I want to be inspirational, or some kind of good influence on them without overburdening them,” he told <a href=#>AARP Magazine</a> while chatting about coparenting with his exes. “It’s their time of life to find out who they are. I always read to them, from childhood on; I think that’s a father’s responsibility. I took them to things I knew they might not love — opera, ballet. They like going to the ball games with me.”</p><p>While Jack preferred to keep his family life as low-key as possible, he dished his kids have actually embraced his celebrity status. “They are very comfortable around show business; they are good set rats,” he continued. “They walked in on my death scene in The Departed. I said, ‘If I can get these two kids really worried, I’m doin’ my job!'”</p><p>Jack even gushed about his youngest son. “Ray might not tell you exactly what he’s up to, but once he’s got his mind set on something, he’s gonna stick to it and take care of business, no matter what me or anybody else says,” the doting dad explained.</p><p><strong>To learn more about Jack’s five kids, keep scrolling!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jmJyjXaO2pLTOpaqopqNigm6vx6KjnaqVo3quscStZK2glWK8tK%2FAq2SwoZ6jsrO%2FjJ%2BYpqGcrnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./peyton-elizabeth-lee-and-milo-manheim.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Peyton Elizabeth Lee and Milo Manheim</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tempestt-bledsoe-birthday-the-cosby-show-cast-then-now-109589.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>It's Tempestt Bledsoe's 43rd Birthday See 'The Cosby Show' Cast Then and Now! - Closer Weekly</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
