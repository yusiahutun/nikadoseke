As of 2022, the name ranked 62 in popularity in the United States.<strong></strong></li><li><strong>Angelo<br></strong>Taken from the Greek word meaning "messenger of God" and a popular Italian name that translates to "angel," Angelo saw a surge of popularity when Adele so dubbed her baby in 2012.</li><li><strong>Castiel<br></strong>Translated as "shield of God" in Hebrew, Castiel is a variation of Cassiel, an angel who appears in extracanonical Jewish, Christian and Islamic mystical literature. It's also the name of an angel on the hit television show, Supernatural.</li><li><strong>Camael</strong><br>A warrior archangel of strength and courage, Camael is said to have led the forces that expelled Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. The name is likely derived from terms meaning "one who sees/stands before God."<strong><strong></strong></strong></li><li><strong>Clarence</strong><br>If you want a cute celestial moniker with throwback appeal, you might want to consider Clarence, the name of the guardian angel in the classic film favorite, It's a Wonderful Life. From the Latin word for bright, it was hugely popular around the turn of the last century.<strong></strong><br></li><li><strong>Daniel<br></strong>The Hebrew word for "God is my judge" Daniel is mentioned in the Book of Enoch, an ancient Jewish religious text, as one of 20 Watcher angels.<strong></strong></li><li><strong>Deangelo</strong><br>The "de" prefix in this appellation, which also can be spelled D'Angelo, denotes "son of" in Italian, though Deangelo is also more commonly translated as "from the angel." Deangelo last peaked in popularity in the early 1990s.</li><li><strong>Engel<br></strong>A German surname, Engel simply means "angel" in the language and is also a feminine Swiss first name.</li><li><strong>Engelbert</strong><br>Or you can expand Engel to Engelbert, or "bright angel" in German. <strong></strong></li><li><strong>Evangelos<br></strong>Meaning "messenger who brings good news" in Greek, this lyrical-sounding name has come to be associated with the Annunciation—the good news brought by the archangel Gabriel to Mary.<strong></strong><strong></strong></li><li><strong>Gabriel</strong><br>An archangel who foretold the birth of Jesus to the Virgin Mary, Gabriel appears in the three Abrahamic religions, sometimes with his trusty trumpet. This lovely name is Hebrew for "God is my strength."</li><li><strong>Haniel</strong><br>An angel in Jewish lore, Haniel is associated with the planet Venus and is said to be the angel of joy. The Hebrew name is derived from the word Ḥēn, which means grace, favor and charm.</li><li><strong>Jerahmeel<br></strong>This unusual Hebrew name, also spelled Jeremiel, is translated as "God shall have mercy." Jerahmeel is said to be a gatekeeper of Heaven, who escorts the deceased in the afterlife.<strong></strong><strong></strong></li><li><strong>Malach</strong><br>A common surname in Israel, Malach or Malachi literally means "messenger" in Hebrew, but can also be translated as "angel." A similar name, Malak, has Arabic origins and means "angel."</li><li><strong>Michael<br></strong>Perhaps the best-loved of all the masculine angel names, Michael is a perennially popular appellation of Hebrew origin. Michael is the archangel who led God's armies in the battle against Satan, making this name a powerful choice indeed.</li><li><strong>Michelangelo</strong><br>This commanding Italian moniker, most famously the name of the Renaissance artist who painted the Sistine Chapel, combines Michael and Angelo and means "one who is like God." <strong></strong></li><li><strong>Phanuel</strong><br>In the Book of Enoch, Phanuel is the fourth angel standing before God after Michael, Raphael and Gabriel. His duties include bearing the throne of God and serving as the angel of judgment. This rare but elegant name means "the face of God."<strong></strong></li><li><strong>Raguel</strong><br>In Judaic lore, Raguel is an archangel of justice, harmony, fairness, redemption and vengeance. His role is to keep watch over fallen angels and demons, delivering judgment upon those who transgress against God. His name is Latin for "friend of God."<strong></strong></li><li><strong>Raphael</strong><br>The archangel of healing, Raphael is often invoked as the patron saint of health and wellness. The name is Hebrew for "God has healed."<strong></strong></li><li><strong>Raziel</strong><br>In the traditions of the Kabbalah, or Jewish mysticism, Raziel is called the "Angel of Secrets," and the "Angel of Mysteries," as well as the"Keeper of All Magic." This enchanting name can be interpreted as "God is my mystery" in Hebrew.</li><li><strong>Seraphim</strong><br>Also spelled Serafim, this unique name means "fiery" in Hebrew and refers to Christianity's highest-ranking angels, often depicted with two or three pairs of wings.</li><li><strong>Seth</strong><br>While it may not be the name of an angel in the Bible, Seth is what Adam and Eve call their third son in the Torah. It's also famously the name of the celestial being played by Nicholas Cage in the swooningly romantic film, City of Angels. Seth means "placed" or "appointed" in Hebrew.</li><li><strong>Uriel</strong><br>One of the seven major archangels, Uriel is the archangel of wisdom and a master of knowledge. This Hebrew name means "God is my light" or "flame of God."<strong></strong></li><li><strong>Zadkiel</strong><br>Also known as Hasdiel, <strong></strong>Zadkiel is an angel of mercy said by some texts to have stopped Abraham from sacrificing his son, Isaac. The name means "God is my righteousness" in Hebrew.</li><li><strong>Zerachiel</strong><br>Zerachiel or Zachariel, which means "God has commanded" in Hebrew, is an archangel who leads souls to judgment.<strong></strong></li><h6 class="css-5zz7ok e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">Baby Names Through the Years</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">Angel Names for Girls</h2><li><strong>Aingeal</strong><br>The Irish word for "angel," Aingeal is (thankfully) easier to say than many names hailing from the Emerald Isle—it's commonly pronounced "angle."</li><li><strong>Angela</strong><br>Derived from the Greek word meaning angel, Angela made the list of top ten most popular names for girls in the U.S. from 1965 to 1979. Favorite variations include the French Angelique, as well as Angelina and Angelica.</li><li><strong>Aniela</strong><br>The Polish word for "messenger of God," the sweet-sounding Aniela is pronounced an-YELL-UH. <strong></strong></li><li><strong>Arella</strong><br>This melodic moniker, which is surging in popularity, is of Hebrew origin and means "messenger of God," or "angel."</li><li><strong>Ariel</strong><br>In Gnostic and mystical Jewish lore, Ariel is known as an angel of nature, while Ariel appears merely as a minor angel in John Milton’s seventeenth-century poem, Paradise Lost. Most famously, it's the name of the title character in the Disney film The Little Mermaid, though in Hebrew Ariel translates ferociously as "lion of God."</li><li><strong>Celeste</strong><br>This classically elegant French and Italian name originated from the Latin word for "heavenly" and is becoming more fashionable in the U.S.</li><li><strong>Celine</strong><br>A variation of Celeste, Celine (or Céline) originated as well from the Latin term for heaven, "caelum." French-Canadian songstress Céline Dion made the name famous world-wide in the 1990s.</li><li><strong>Charmeine</strong><br>In popular angel lore, Charmeine is said to be the angel of harmony.</li><li><strong>Devi</strong><br>In ancient Sanskrit Devi is specifically the word for "goddess," but it can also be translated to mean "heavenly, divine, exalted and shining ones"—all terms that can be used to describe angels, too.<strong></strong></li><li><strong>Diana<br></strong>With Greek and Latin roots, and referring to the Roman goddess of the same name, Diana means "divine," "heavenly" and even "holy." More recently, of course, it was the given name of the beloved and undeniably angelic Princess of Wales.<strong></strong></li><li><strong>Dina<br></strong>Also known as Jophiel, Dina, which means "judgment" in Hebrew, is an archangel in Christian and Jewish angelology associated with wisdom, beauty and art.<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></li><li><strong>Eloa</strong><br>The Portuguese word for "goddess," Eloa was an angel of compassion in Alfred de Vigny's epic 19th-century poem, Eloa or the Sister of Angels. She was said to have been born of the tear Christ shed over the death of Lazarus.<strong></strong></li><li><strong>Evangeline</strong><br>The feminine form of Evangelos, this romantic-sounding name is taken from the Greek term for "bearer of good news."</li><li><strong>Gabriella</strong><br>This flat-out gorgeous name, which is the feminine of Gabriel in Italian, has graced the top 100 names list in the U.S. since 2000.</li><li><strong>Gloria</strong><br>Like Celeste, Gloria has an angelic vibe thanks to its Latin origins—gloria means "immortal glory" in the language. It's also used in one of the Virgin Mary's titles: Maria de Gloria.</li><li><strong>Halo</strong><br>The glowing circle of light commonly shown in artwork above the heads of angels and holy beings, Halo has its origins in the Greek word for "disc of the sun or moon." Now commonly referencing a divine aura, it has been in use as an English name since the 19th century.</li><li><strong>Heaven</strong><br>The abode of the angels, and an exceptional name for a baby girl, Heaven has Germanic roots, though its first use as an English term dates to before 1150.<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></li><li><strong>Lailah</strong><br>In Jewish mythology and some interpretations of the Talmud, Lailah is an angel of the night, conception, and pregnancy.</li><li><strong>Michaela<br></strong>The feminine version of Michael, this appellation translates as "who resembles God" in Hebrew. Variations include Mikaela, Mikayla, and Michela.</li><li><strong>Michelle</strong><br>The feminine form of Michel, which is derived from Michael, this sophisticated Gallic name continues to remain on-trend, thanks to celebs like First Lady Michelle Obama.<strong></strong><strong></strong></li><li><strong>Muriel</strong><br>One of Western Christianity's dominion angels who govern celestial objects, Muriel is the angel of the month of June and is associated with the astrological sign of Cancer. The name is taken from the Irish word for "sparkling or shining sea."</li><li><strong></strong><strong><strong>Nevaeh</strong></strong><br>If you don't want to go with the forthright Heaven for your little one, you might want to consider Nevaeh, which is simply heaven spelled backward. Unlike just about any other name on this list, it's American in origin and offers a nicely modern feel.</li><li><strong>Oriel<br></strong>Another name for the archangel Uriel, this form is more gender-neutral and works for girls, too. It doesn't just sound pretty, either—it's taken from the Latin word for "golden."<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></li><li><strong>Regina<br></strong>In the Catholic faith, the Virgin Mary is sometimes known as Queen of the Angels or Regina Angelorum in Latin. This regal name is thus not only noble but angelic as well.<strong></strong></li><li><strong>Seraphina<br></strong>The feminine of Seraphim, this name means "fiery" in Hebrew and refers to Christianity's highest-ranking angels, often depicted with two or three pairs of wings. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner put Seraphina in the spotlight in 2009 when they chose it for their daughter's name.</li><h6 class="css-5zz7ok e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">More Baby Name Inspiration</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq e19xk9rq1"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/5460e456-5fa2-42c2-a6fe-be50915b6d55_1546979506.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Jill Gleeson" title="Headshot of Jill Gleeson" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jill Gleeson is a travel journalist and memoirist based in the Appalachian Mountains of western Pennsylvania who has written for websites and publications including Good Housekeeping, Woman’s Day, Country Living, Washingtonian, Gothamist, Canadian Traveller, and EDGE Media Network.
