Bye." Appearing on <strong><a href=#>"The View"</a></strong> this morning from her Calabasas home, <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> confirmed her sister wasn't joking.</p><p>Kim said Kourtney was "taking time off from filming" come the show's mid-season. "I'm sure if we're filming and she comes down to dinner, of course we'll see her on,"she added. "But as far as her getting a schedule of where to be and what time and places and all that, that's not really gonna happen for her for a while."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:fd69a0ba-4d75-5a68-894c-5c9d85c6d9cd data-container-ref=toofab:article:09c5156e-e00f-531c-bbfe-f71d25877837 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e6/5by4/2020/03/27/e693417b16ef5195a044402da1814c2e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">E!</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">KUWTK Recap: Nasty Kim-Kourtney Fight and Khloe's Complicated Thoughts on Tristan</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The decision came after Kourtney continued to express frustration with filming in the premiere, complaining about having to get her glam on to shoot. "She'd complain every time she'd be there and be such a buzzkill, but not make a definitive choice," Kim continued, adding Kourtney's "limbo was really frustrating for everyone."</p><p>The premiere also included a physical altercation between the two sisters that ended in kicks, scratches and slaps.</p><p>"I never want to result to violence like that," Kim said on "The View." She added, "Looking back, it also made me realize what Kourtney's really feeling and going through ... It made me more sympathetic to her situation."</p><p>"I think what people didn't see is I had all these scratches," said Kim, explaining why she went so hard at her sister at the end of the episode. "I was bleeding ... [I] saw red." She added that production was shut down for a week after the incident.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@KimKardashian</a> West shares what life has been like in her home with four kids while social distancing, saying she has a “newfound respect for teachers.”</p><p>"You really have to put yourself on the back burner and just focus on the kids.” <a href=#>https://t.co/gWnO6smvmY </a><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wmjljQuiDh</a></p><a href=# rel=noopener>@TheView</a><p>During her appearance on "The View," Kim also spoke about how lockdown has been going for her entire family, as she's hunkered down with her four kids and <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong>.</p><p>"Today was the first day that I actually brushed my hair and put on some makeup," she said. "I had <strong><a href=#>Kylie</a></strong> -- she's been the only sister that I've seen -- I had her come over and do my makeup because she's so much better at it than me. We're taking this extremely seriously. We haven't seen any sisters and let me say, being at home with four kids, if I ever thought for a minute that I wanted another one, that is out the door ... it's really tough."</p><p>That being said, she added that she does love having time with Kanye, since they travel so much in their regular lives.</p><p>"I think the family part of it all, going on walks outside, we've watched every single movie you can possibly imagine. I've been showing the kids all these '80s movies like 'Harry and the Henderson' and stuff that they wouldn't watch and it's so much fun," she continued. "I love all the family bonding stuff. I've been doing laundry and cooking, the kids just got on Spring Break, thank god. Being a teacher too -- I have a newfound respect for teachers. They deserve so much. It's been tough juggling it all and you really have to put yourself on the back burner and just focus on the kids."</p><p>She added that the whole family has Zoom dinners together where they'll each make their own plates, before eating and talking in front of their computers. They also keep in touch via FaceTime and a family group text.</p><p>"It was just really nice to see Kylie this morning, even just for a second while she was doing my makeup," said Kim. "And even just everything we wanted to catch up on. Our kids haven't see each other, the cousins haven't played together."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3F7j2xmbGlfoLauecqaqZ2Zo522orqMpKauqqSjsrp5xaKeoaxdqbWmedWinLBn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./506778-best-groomsmen-invitation-wording-messages-cards.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Best groomsmen invitation wording and messages for cards</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kaia-gerber-and-cindy-crawfords-chicest-ever-style-moments-mother-daughter-duos-iconic-versace.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kaia Gerber and Cindy Crawfords chicest-ever style moments: from the mother-daughter duos icon</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
