Since then, the actress has gone from strength to strength professionally.

As one of the highest-paid actresses during a point in her career, Berry got paid millions to appear in movies.</p><p>As one of the highest-paid actresses, Berry earned between $8 million to $12 million per movie. She also invested in several businesses, increasing her total worth and earnings.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>According to current reports, Halle Berry’s net worth <a href=#>stands </a>above the $120 million mark.

Berry was not impressed by the rectangular design because it didn’t convey her personality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/6a/dd/2b/6add2bdd569c64e7b3fbe39b52c27fc4.jpg><p>The actress suggested the company add a wave imprint on the back of the bottle to express a connection to nature. She also wanted rugged copper-colored rigs which resembled bangles added to the neck. Speaking about her collaboration with the company Berry <a href=#>said</a>:</p><p><strong>“My strategy was to present something to people that was honestly me. If I don’t like it, my name’s not on it. If I haven’t been there dibbling and dabbling, giving my opinion on things, my name’s not on it.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Her first fragrance, “Halle,” came out in March 2009 after two years of development. Unfortunately, her debut coincided with the tanking of the economy, but surprisingly the fragrance did very well commercially.</p><p>While fragrance sales fell by 8.7% during the first half of 2009, “Halle” debuted as the best-selling fragrance in stores like Target, Walgreen, Kohl’s, and CVS. The strong showing of the fragrance got tagged as an anomaly in the beauty market.</p><p>Even the vice president of Coty, Stephen C., expressed his surprise. He explained the company never projected so much instant success because of the competition from other celebrity fragrances.</p><p>Thankfully for Berry and the company, their decision to include Eau de parfum, shower gel, body lotion, and natural deodorant at lower-end retailers boosted the sale of the fragrance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Halle_Berry_Lives_a_Frugal_Lifestyle></span><strong>Halle Berry Lives a Frugal Lifestyle</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although she is one of the richest actresses in Hollywood, Berry lives a very low-key lifestyle.

However, the actress who <a href=#>witnessed </a>her mother struggle to make ends meet as a child has learned to be frugal.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Halle_Berry_in_a_Ceasars_Commercial></span><strong>Halle Berry in a Ceasar’s Commercial</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When the Ceasar’s Sportsbook and Best Friends Animal Society’s commercial to put some cute kittens on display debuted during the Super Bowl, a familiar figure sat in the middle surrounded by these cats.</p><p>It turned out to be the “Catwoman” herself, Halle Berry dressed up in a Cleopatra-esque look. The actress completed her look with shiny thigh-high gold boots and a flowing gold and blue ornamented tunic. She also had a short black wig and glossy gold eye makeup.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The text on the screen detailed the actress as “Cleopatra playing with some kittens.” Berry then playfully picked up one of the kittens and called him “Brutus” before encouraging viewers to foster a kitten. Speaking after the advert dubbed the “Puppy Bowl” aired, Berry <a href=#>disclosed</a>:</p><p><strong>“It was special working with kittens, and I’m so glad that we could support such a good cause while making a fun spot with Caesars.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In her statement, the CEO of Best Friends Animal Society declared their excitement at millions of Americans seeing the advert.
