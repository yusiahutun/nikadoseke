His wife, Sally, a former model from Seattle, takes shots of wheatgrass and exercises at Equinox. Married 19 years, the Perrins have definitely gone L.A. "I love it," gushes Michel. "I love the culture, I love the people, and the weather is incredibly energizing."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>SEE LOOKBOOK:</strong> <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/interiors-entertaining/advice/g75/michel-sally-perrin-lookbook-0607/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="MICHEL & SALLY PERRIN" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">MICHEL & SALLY PERRIN</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Perrins relocated to Southern California from Paris last year in part so their daughters, Chloé, 16, and Emma, 12, could perfect their English before college. The lifestyle change comes just as Michel is relaunching the family business, moving the 114-year-old Perrin beyond its roots in the leather-glove business and into designer handbags. The first collection, which hit U.S. stores in April, features hand-stitched bags from four Paris-based designers, some containing design details reminiscent of gloves.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Perrin family (including Poupi the cat) have adapted to Los Angeles like skilled chameleons. Michel, 48, is quite taken with L.A.'s car culture, cruising around in an Aston Martin DB9 "James Bond car." He even loves California wine: "I found a pinot noir, Fort Ross from the Sonoma coast. I'm picky about wine. It's really amazing, and I'm not just saying that to be nice."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Their new single-story Beverly Hills home, designed in 1950 by Victor Gruen, father of the American shopping mall, is a shrine to midcentury modern, the West Coast style du jour. "It's quintessential L.A., lots of glass and light," says Sally, 43. "If you sit in one room, you can see through the entire house.... I can spy on the girls."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lounging in the living room, one first spies a curtain of tinkling capiz seashells shimmering in the dining room, which opens onto a patio. Glass walls direct the eye out toward the backyard pool, a perfect spot for barbecues. The couple are already planning an S&M party (standing for Sally and Michel, also steaks and martinis). While Sally, in a floral-print Marni shift dress, shows off the four-bedroom home, she opens a wooden rolltop wet bar in the living room. "This I just love!" she exclaims. "It's very Frank Sinatra. Swanky." It's only fitting, then, that the couple's decor, chosen by interior architect Chahan Minassian, was inspired by the cult 1968 Peter Sellers film <i>The Party.</i></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sally and Michel are thrilled to have the perfect venue to indulge their penchant for American kitsch. "I love a great tuna casserole, and I'm dying to do a party with all those foods," Sally says, laughing. "We'll break out the cherry tomatoes and little toothpicks."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Perrins are also avid art collectors. The house showcases contemporary work from Nancy Lorenz, sculpture from César, and, in the master bedroom, a commissioned piece inspired by the Alexander Calder headboard in Peggy Guggenheim's Venice villa. One wall hanging is made of deflated balloons. "I like a little whimsy," Sally declares.</p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sally's fashion sense has also been transformed since she moved to L.A. "I have a much more casual style, although I like to make an effort," she says, naming Comme des Garçons, Alexander McQueen, and J. Mendel among her favorites. "In Paris, it's more about labels. Here it's more about Hollywood nostalgia." She recently purchased a chartreuse 1950s bathing suit from vintage store the Paper Bag Princess, and she collects sunglasses from local flea markets. Chloé and Emma sometimes steal her cashmere sweaters for the cool evenings. "Luckily, their shoe sizes are bigger than mine!" she says with a laugh.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Speaking of shoes, there's one L.A. habit Sally can't get used to: "I don't get the flip-flop thing." She also went against the California grain with her hairstyle, switching from dark blonde in Paris to a short brunette pixie cut.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Perrins' degree of acclimation is remarkable, considering their traditional lifestyle in France, where they have kept their 17th-century Normandy manor in Eure decorated with period antiques. Michel's family history in the leather-glove business extends back generations, and his brother, Henri, still oversees the Perrin tannery, now in Vietnam. Though fashion trends dictated a business switch, Michel intends to update the glove styles and package some avant-garde pairs with his bags. Sally runs a business called French Finds, which sources antiques for American buyers. Now she also hopes to host a TV show about decorating and entertaining.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her hostess philosophy? "There's elegance in simplicity," Sally says. "I don't like fussy, and I can't stand pretension." To loosen things up at a party, she likes to play silly games at the table, often handing out the Pivot questionnaire before dessert, "when people are well oiled." Then, to cap it off, "I have an enormous bingo cage I bring out after an elegant meal. It looks like a disco ball, and out pops the number. You can't say <i>bingo;</i> you have to scream it!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGihnqmys7XOq6pmnZ6psrPAwKKloqaXZK6lwsicnGiZZmd8rrXCoZylZaOWua3FjKmcq6qZo3pxgo9wZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./401008-abby-phillip-husband-wedding-parents-family-salary-children-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Abby Phillip: husband, wedding, parents, family, salary, children</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./31-facts-about-the-movie-geralds-game.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>31 Facts about the movie Gerald's Game</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
