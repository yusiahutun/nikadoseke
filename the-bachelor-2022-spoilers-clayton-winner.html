Clayton’s Bachelor season started filming on September 29, 2021, and Salley had her Bachelorette party in Mexico as early as August 16, 2021, according to an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram photo</a> posted by her friend. Salley and Avery’s wedding date was September 26, 2021 (three days before The Bachelor season 26 started filming), according to their wedding registry page on Crate & Barrel’s website. Salley and Avery broke up a couple weeks before their wedding date, according to Reality Steve.</p><p>Salley was the first contestant eliminated on The Bachelor season 26 and didn’t even film her Night One limo entrance, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reality Steve</a>. Reality Steve reported that production learned of Salley’s engagement to Avery days before Clayton’s Bachelor season started filming and asked if she still wanted to be on the show, to which she said no. Production told Clayton about Salley’s engagement, and they had a talk in his hotel room, where she told him about her decision to quit his Bachelor season. Clayton is quoted in the premiere saying that the first rose of his Bachelor season was rejected, which was a reference to Salley deciding to not stay on the show.</p><p>Avery is a neurosurgeon and an assistant professor of neurosurgery at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia. Avery also owns his own practice in Virginia and specializes in “adult degenerative scoliosis, complex spine revisions, and minimally invasive spinal procedures.” Salley, who works as an associate robotics and navigation consultant at Medtronic, nods to Avery’s profession as a neurosurgeon in her bio for The Bachelor, in which she references Grey’s Anatomy couple Meredith Grey and Derek Shepherd (who was also a neurosurgeon). Salley is a real-life Meredith Grey looking for her McDreamy. She is a spine surgery robot operator who keeps a tight circle of friends that she likes to have dinner and drinks with but is a career-focused girl who is usually in bed by 11 p.m,” her Bachelor bio reads. “She describes herself as religious, family-oriented and adventurous. She says she wants a man who is loyal, fun and willing to give her lots of attention because, why lie?”</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>Claire Is Eliminated on Night One After She Drinks Too Much</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Claire-H-The-Bachelor-2022.jpeg><p>Claire Heilig, a 28-year-old spray tanner from Virginia Beach, Virginia, is the second contestant eliminated on The Bachelor 2022 after she becomes too drunk and is sent home before the First Rose Ceremony. “We’ve got a drunk girl this season.

Dean, who also starred on Bachelor in Paradise season 5 and 6, confirmed the relationship on an episode of his “Help! I Suck at Dating” podcast in October 2021. “She was, like, one of the main exes. She was my girlfriend from college,” he said. “Producers called me and were like, ‘Hey, we’re thinking of casting this person — what do you think of her? We know that you dated 10 years ago.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, she’s great. If she gets selected for the show, she’ll either win the show or she’ll be the next Bachelorette.’ And I firmly believe that.”</p><p>Blake, who was also on Bachelor in Paradise season 6, also confirmed that he dated Gabby for a “couple months” on an episode of the “Behind the Rose” podcast in October 2021. “We like the same girls, man. I didn’t know Dean until obviously, like, 2018, but Gabby was a good friend of one of my very good friends from college, they were roommates,” he said. “I met Gabby long before I was on The Bachelorette, like, I want to say maybe 2015 or 2016. We hung out for a little bit, so I know her very well. And Dean, I don’t know how it came up, but one time, me and Dean were sitting there — I think we were in Buffalo, and he mentioned Gabby — and I was like, ‘How do you know Gabby?’ And he was like, ‘Dude, she was, like, my girl in college, you know, we were in love and blah blah.’”</p><p>He continued, “She’s fun. She has a very outgoing personality, very loud, like, when she walks into a room, you know she’s in a room. You never know if the lead is going to be into something like that. You never know if they like the more shy, quiet type or they like the loud, outgoing type, but she’s definitely very loud, very outgoing, she has a lot of friends. So if Clayton’s into that, I see her getting hometowns, for sure. She’s a beautiful woman. … They’re gonna have the football player, cheerleader story line.”</p><h2><span class=s1>Shanae Is Clayton’s Bachelor Villain</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Shenae-A-The-Bachelor-2022.jpeg><p>Shanae Ankney, a 29-year-old recruiter from Sycamore, Ohio, is the villain of The Bachelor 2022, according to Reality Steve, who reported that Shanae wasn’t on the winning team of a group date in week four but crashes their party and breaks their trophy, which is seen in the trailer.

Reality Steve confirmed that the winner of The Bachelor season 26 with Clayton Echard is Susie Evans, a 28-year-old wedding videographer from Virginia Beach, Virginia, however, she rejects Clayton in the end. According to Reality Steve, Susie was eliminated in third place during Fantasy Suites after Clayton told her that he was in love and had sex with his other two finalists—Rachel Recchia, a 25-year-old flight instructor from Clermont, Florida, had the first, and Gabby Windey, a 30-year-old ICU nurse from Denver, Colorado—and Susie questioned how he could be serious about their relationship when he was intimate with someone else. The fight escalates, and Clayton decides to eliminate Susie after she tells him how she doesn’t know if she can stay on the show if he’s in love with other women.</p><p>At the final three Rose Ceremony with Rachel and Gabby, Clayton tells both Rachel and Gabby that he’s in love and had sex with both of them. Both Rachel and Gabby walk away and try to leave the show, which leads Clayton to beg them to stay. Both Rachel and Gabby agree to stay and Clayton gives them both roses. The finale continues with Gabby and Rachel meeting Clayton’s parents. After Gabby and Rachel’s meeting with Clayton’s parents, Clayton realizes that he still has feelings for Susie and decides to talk to her. Host Jesse Palmer knocks on Susie’s door and tells her that Clayton wants to talk to her. Susie agrees and she and Clayton reunite. Susie then also meets Clayton’s parents, after which he decides he wants to choose her at the Final Rose Ceremony and eliminate Rachel and Gabby. Clayton tells Rachel and Gabby about his decision separately in their hotel rooms. Rachel was more sad, while Gabby was more angry at Clayton. At the Final Rose Ceremony, Clayton arrives with an engagement ring and a plan to propose to Susie, but before he can do so, Susie tells Clayton that she’s not in love with him and walks away, which forces Clayton to leave The Bachelor single.</p><p>Reality Steve also reported that Clayton’s relationships with Rachel and Gabby ended once he eliminated with them, and there was no hope for them to get back together after he was rejected by Susie. “There is zero chance he is rekindling anything with Gabby or Rachel. They have nothing to do with anything since they left Iceland,” Reality Steve wrote. <span>“I don’t think anyone expected it to end the way that it did, including myself, nor did I want it to be that way. There was a lot of things that I just never would’ve thought would’ve happened the way they did. So everyone will be kind of surprised. I wish it could have went any other direction, but it went the direction that it did. Ultimately, I had to react accordingly,” Clayton said of how his </span>Bachelor<span> season ended on the Women Tell All.&nbsp;</span></p><p>During his “After the Final Rose” special in March 2022, Clayton revealed that he left Iceland to “what I thought was my normal life” until Susie contacted him to ask him to take her back. “I was absolutely shocked there was maybe that came from all of it,” Clayton said. Susie later came out during the special and confirmed that she and Clayton were back together and still dating. “We’re really happy and we’re happy to be here today,” she said. “That’s my boyfriend.” Susie confessed that she and Clayton “took some steps back,” but are currently in love. “I can confidently say yeah, he’s incredible,” she said.</p><p>Clayton and Susie also confessed that they expect some backlash for their relationship and “could have done better” with how their finale played out. They also revealed that they’re planning to move to Virginia (Susie’s hometown) together and their relationship is “serious.” Engagement ring designer Neil Lane was in the audience, and host Jesse Palmer also asked Clayton if a proposal was coming, to which Clayton responded that he has other things for his relationship with Susie planned for now. Clayton then asked Susie if she would officially accept his final rose, to which she did.</p><p>Reality Steve’s spoilers come after a Reddit post by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@workingbach13</a> in December 2021 theorized that the final two were Susie or Rachel. The post suspected this because Susie and Rachel both followed Cary Fetman on Instagram. Cary is the Bachelor franchise’s stylist and costume designer who often styles the lead and the last two contestants for the Final Rose Ceremony.</p><p>The post speculated that Susie could’ve won Clayton’s Bachelor season because she was the first of the final three Bachelor contestants to return to social media, which has been consistent with past Bachelor and Bachelorette winners. Susie’s family and friends also follow Clayton on Instagram. A fan account has also posted an alleged screenshot of Susie commenting heart eye emojis on one of Clayton’s recent Instagram photos, which he liked. Susie also received the Pretty Woman date—a.k.a. a date where the lead and the contestant go on a shopping spree—in Vienna, Austria, in week seven, which has been indicative of other Bachelor and Bachelorette winners who have had similar dates, such as Rachel Kirkconnell from The Bachelor season 25 with Matt James; Hannah Ann Sluss from The Bachelor season 24 with Peter Weber; Becca Kufrin from The Bachelor season 22 with Arie Luyendyk Jr.; and Bryan Abasolo from The Bachelorette season 13 with Rachel Lindsay. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reality Steve</a> also hinted in a tweet in November 2021 that there’s evidence that Susie won Clayton’s Bachelor season. “Do I post pics of Susie from Clayton’s season out last night so the subsequent dissection of the pics, freak out, and speculation from the fans can commence?” he tweeted.</p><p class=p3>The post, however, also speculated that Rachel could’ve won Clayton’s Bachelor season because she returned to social media at the exact time Clayton did. Rachel’s mom also followed Clayton on Instagram but unfollowed him when filming ended. Rachel Clayton also both liked the same Instagram photo of The Bachelor host Jesse Palmer 20 minutes after it was posted, even though Rachel doesn’t follow Jesse on Instagram. Rachel was also the only contestant from Clayton’s final three that liked season 18 Bachelorette Michelle Young’s first photo with her winner, Nayte Olukoya, which Clayton also liked.</p><p>Reality Steve confirmed in February 2022 that Clayton does not have a traditional ending, there was no finality to his Bachelor season. Reality Steve also reported that Clayton didn’t have a traditional “Final Rose Ceremony” with two women, where he picks out a ring, one woman arrives and is eliminated and the other woman arrives and he proposes to them. Reality Steve also reported that he didn’t have any “Happy Couple” visits (a.k.a. when the Bachelor and their winner have a secret weekend together) the whole season.</p><p>For Clayton’s proposal to Susie, it’s almost certain that the ring was designed by Neil Lane, a celebrity jeweler, who has created engagement rings for The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise since 2008. In a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>, former host Chris Harrison revealed that Bachelor Nation couples have to stay together for a certain amount of time, otherwise they have to return the free engagement ring to Neil Lane. “There’s some rule, after a certain number of years, you get to keep it anyway,” he said. “But after months… it goes back.”</p><p>Lane told <a href=# rel=noopener>StyleCaster</a> in 2016 that he doesn’t know where the rings go, but that he designs them with the hope that the couple to stays together. “I make rings hoping that people stay together forever, but after they get the ring, I don’t have a say in it, and what happens after that, I don’t know,” he said. “Where the ring goes, I have to say, I don’t really know. I just say it goes to ring heaven.”</p><h2><span>Who is </span>The Bachelorette<span> 2022?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Susie-E-The-Bachelor-2022.jpeg><p>Who is the next Bachelorette in 2022? Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey, two contestants from&nbsp;The Bachelor season 26 with Clayton Echard, were announced as the season 19 Bachelorettes at the “After the Final Rose” special in March 2022. “After unwaveringly supporting each other through a devastating dual breakup in the season 26 finale of ‘The Bachelor,’ fan favorites and fierce women Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia will stand by each other’s side yet again as they set out on a journey to find love,” ABC said in a press release at the time.</p><p>Rachel,<span> a 25-year-old flight instructor from Clermont, Florida, and Gabby, a 30-year-old ICU nurse from Denver, Colorado, were both eliminated in the final three after Clayton chose Susie Evans, a 28-year-old wedding videographer from Virginia Beach, Virginia, and sent home Rachel and Gabby before the Final Rose Ceremony. </span>Susie was the winner of Clayton’s Bachelor season after Clayton chose her at the Final Rose Ceremony. Before the Final Rose Ceremony, however, Clayton and Susie have a fight during their Fantasy Suite Date after he tells her that he had sex and is in love with both Rachel and Gabby, and she questions how he could be serious about their relationship when he was intimate with someone else. The argument escalates, and Clayton decides to eliminate Susie after she expresses how she doesn’t know if she can stay on the show if he’s in love with other women. Clayton and the producers convince Susie to return to Clayton’s Bachelor season. At the Final Rose Ceremony, Clayton—who eliminated Rachel and Gabby before the finale—told Susie he loved her, but she told him that she didn’t love him back and left. <span>“I don’t think anyone expected it to end the way that it did, including myself, nor did I want it to be that way. There was a lot of things that I just never would’ve thought would’ve happened the way they did. So everyone will be kind of surprised. I wish it could have went any other direction, but it went the direction that it did. Ultimately, I had to react accordingly,” Clayton said of how his </span>Bachelor<span> season ended on the Women Tell All.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Gabby-The-Bachelor.jpg><p>According to Reality Steve, Clayton’s relationships with Rachel and Gabby ended once he eliminated them, and there was no chance for them to get back together with Clayton. He also reported that The Bachelorette season 19 starts filming in late March 2022. “I can’t believe anything you say, not one thing,” Gabby told Clayton during The Bachelor season 26 finale after he told her that he chose Susie over her. “You sound actually ridiculous because you don’t want to admit that you’re wrong…Your actions speak way louder than words.” Rachel, for her part, told Clayton that he would regret his decision. “I promise you that when you look back at this…this is going to haunt you, the fact that you let me go,” she said. “I tried so hard, I gave you everything. I fought for this every single day and you never once fought for me.”</p><p>Before the season 19 Bachelorettes were announced,&nbsp;Reality Steve also confirmed that Gabby was a frontrunner to become the next lead.A&nbsp;source also confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News</a> at the time that producers were considering Gabby to the next Bachelorette due to the positive fan response to her on social media. <span>In an interview with Us Weekly, Genevieve Parisi, a 26-year-old bartender from Los Angeles, California, revealed that Gabby was her choice for the next Bachelorette because of her sense of humor. “I would say Susie or Gabby,” she said. “Rachel is amazing too, but honestly, I think Gabby would just bring such a different element to it. She’s so funny. And as you see, as this season goes on, she really has a great heart and she’s an emotional person. And it’s hard to see that because she just jokes all the time. She’s always laughing and just joking with people, but she has a very big heart and I think she deserves love so much and she just would be so entertaining to watch.” Serene Russell, a 26-year-old elementary school teacher from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and another contestant from Clayton’s season, also noted Gabby as strong choice for the next Bachelorette.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Read on for where The Bachelor 2022 filmed, including where Hometown Dates were and where the Final Rose Ceremony was shot.</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>The Bachelor Mansion in Agoura Hills, California</span></h2><p>The Bachelor season 26 was the first Bachelor or Bachelorette season since the current health crisis to film at the Bachelor Mansion in Agoura Hills, California.

Whatever it takes.” After his elimination, Clayton received a letter from Michelle’s student, who cheers him on. “This just shows me I want kids one day,” Clayton said as he read the letter.

The Bachelor season 26 host is Jesse Palmer, who was the season 5 Bachelor in 2004 and was the youngest Bachelor in Bachelor Nation history at 24 years old. During The Bachelor season 5 finale, Jesse gave his Final Rose to Jessica Bowlin, but didn’t propose to her. Jesse and Jessica continued to date, but ended their relationship a few weeks after the finale of their Bachelor season aired. In June 2020, Jesse and his girlfriend, Emely Fardo, married in an intimate wedding in New York City. Jesse told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in November 2021 that he and Emely planned to marry in Provence, France, before the current health crisis cancelled their wedding date. “We had originally planned a wedding in Provence, France, for summer 2020, which was postponed until summer of 2021 due to the pandemic, but we didn’t want to wait any longer,” he said at the time. “So, we had a small, private and intimate ceremony with close friends who lived in New York City.”</p><p>Jesse graduated from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played football for the Florida Gators, in 2001 with a bachelor’s of arts degree in political science and a bachelor’s of science degree in marketing. After graduation, Jesse was drafted by the National Football League to play for the New York Giants. He played with the team for four seasons from 2001 to 2005 as a quarterback. After the New York Giants, Jesse was drafted by the Canadian Football League to play for the Montreal Alouettes. He played with the team until 2005 when he was signed by the San Francisco 49ers. He then resigned with the Montreal Alouettes in 2006 before he retired from football in 2007 to pursue a broadcasting career. Since his broadcasting career started, Jesse has worked with networks like Fox, NFL Network, ESPN, ABC and SEC Network. He’s also guest starred on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and made guest appearances on shows like Recipe to Riches and Good Morning America, and hosted the Food Network’s Spring Baking Championship and Holiday Baking Championship.</p><p>Jesse was announced as The Bachelor season 26 host in September 2021. “For more than 20 years, The Bachelor has brought the world dozens of unforgettable love stories, including at one time, my own,” he said at the time. “Falling in love is one of life’s greatest gifts, and I am humbled by the opportunity to return to the show as host this season to offer the newest Bachelor advice gained from firsthand experience and I am grateful to play a small part in his journey.” The announcement came after Chris Harrison, the former host of Bachelor Nation, confirmed in June 2021 that he had retired as the franchise’s host after 19 years. “I’ve had a truly incredible run as host of The Bachelor franchise and now I’m excited to start a new chapter,” he wrote in an Instagram post at the time. “I’m so grateful to Bachelor Nation for all of the memories we’ve made together. While my two-decade journey is wrapping up, the friendships I’ve made will last a lifetime.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a> reported at the time that Chris received a mid-range, eight-figure settlement as part of exit plan with ABC, the network that airs the Bachelor franchise, and Warner Bros. Television, the company that produces the Bachelor shows. The magazine also reported that Harrison’s settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. Chris’ decision to retire as Bachelor Nation’s host came after he was slammed for&nbsp;his response to season 25 Bachelor contestant <a href=# rel=noopener>Rachael Kirkconnell’s racism</a> scandal in February 2021. <a href=# rel=noopener>Rachael</a>, the <a href=# rel=noopener>winner of Matt James’ season</a>, faced backlash at the time when photos resurfaced of her at an Old South Antebellum-themed party at Georgia College in 2018. Before the pictures went viral, Rachael was already under controversy after her former high school classmate accused her on TikTok of bullying her and other students for dating Black men. Other TikTok users then exposed Rachael for liking social media photos of her friends in culturally insensitive costumes and with Confederate flags.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Chris came under controversy</a> after he was interviewed about the scandal by season 13 Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay on Extra. During the interview, Chris asked fans to give Rachael “grace” and explained that he didn’t find the Antebellum party photos offensive because they just looked like pictures a college student takes at a party. Harrison also questioned whether the photos would be considered racially insensitive in 2018 when they were taken. After the interview, many fans slammed Harrison and accused him of excusing Rachael’s behavior.</p><p>ABC confirmed in March 2021 that Chris wouldn’t host season 17 of The Bachelorette and would be replaced by Tayshia and Kaitlyn. “Chris Harrison will not be hosting the next season of The Bachelorette,” ABC said in a statement at the time. “We support Chris in the work that he is committed to doing. In his absence, former Bachelorettes Tayshia Adams and Kaitlyn Bristowe will support the new Bachelorette through next season. As we continue the dialogue around achieving greater equity and inclusion within The Bachelor franchise, we are dedicated to improving the BIPOC representation of our crew, including among the executive producer ranks. These are important steps in effecting fundamental change so that our franchise is a celebration of love that is reflective of our world.” He officially retired as the Bachelor Nation’s host in June 2021.</p><p>The Bachelor airs on Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC and is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu</a>.
