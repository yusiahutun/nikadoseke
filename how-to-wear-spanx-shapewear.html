Even if you don't own a pair, you've definitely heard the name of this shapewear powerhouse from your friends, relatives, or favorite celebrity. What started as an act of necessity involving a pair of scissors and pantyhose (more on that later) has flourished into a brand of smoothing and sculpting garments that people of all shapes and sizes swear by — and not just for formal events. For some, Spanx is an everyday staple.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While shapewear may have once had a negative connotation, now people are outing their love for contouring undergarments, with Spanx considered a favorite for creating a seamless base and helping clothes fit better. Ahead, everything to know about the brand and its products, just in case you're not caught up.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-spanx></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Spanx?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Spanx is a brand of shapewear founded in 1998 by Sara Blakely. After trying to find smoothing undergarments to wear underneath her white pants to no avail, Blakely took matters into her own hands (quite literally).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Using a pair of scissors, she cut the feet off her control-top pantyhose, and Spanx's footless, body-shaping pantyhose was born. The company has since expanded its offerings from smoothing pantyhose and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bodysuits</a>&nbsp;to waist-cinchers, activewear, undergarments, leggings — and everything in between — all made from lightweight and breathable material.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-its-for></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who It's For</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Spanx's mission is to help people of all shapes and sizes feel their best in their clothes. Sizes range from XS to 3X. The brand also makes a few pieces specifically for those who are pregnant, such as the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Mama Mid-Thigh Shaping Sheers</a>, which provide "under-belly and lower back support." In 2010, Spanx introduced its first line of menswear. What started as a collection of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>compression undershirts</a>&nbsp;has grown to include underwear and socks.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-it-works></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How It Works</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The purpose of Spanx is to smooth out any bumps, ensuring your clothes fit just right and creating a flawless finish. That being said, there are three levels of compression to choose from based on your needs.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Level 1: Smoothing</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These are foundational, base-layer pieces that act as a second skin to smooth out imperfections.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Level 2: Shaping</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These pieces offer extra compression and are a little extra firming than your standard shapewear.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Level 3: Sculpting</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a total transformation, this level of maximum compression provides lifting and optimal slimming.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-finding-your-fit></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Finding Your Fit</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Finding your perfect fit is directly related to measurements (waist, hip, bust, etc.), so your best bet is going with sizes you normally take in clothing — not going smaller, which will likely create discomfort. For leggings and tights, you'll also want to take your height into account. Once you know your exact measurements, you can quickly compare them to a chart on the Spanx site to determine which size is best.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-choosing-a-color></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Choosing a Color</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It all depends on what you plan to wear your shapewear with. Should your wardrobe consist of lighter colors, you might want to go with a pair of Spanx similar to your skin tone, and, thankfully, the brand offers a variety of nude shades. There are also other neutral options, such as white and black, and Spanx even sells printed underwear, which will work under darker pieces.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-to-wear></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When to Wear</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It all depends on what you plan to wear your shapewear with. Should your wardrobe consist of lighter colors, you might want to go with a pair of Spanx similar to your skin tone, and, thankfully, the brand offers a variety of nude shades. There are also other neutral options, such as white and black, and Spanx even sells printed underwear, which will work under darker pieces.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With such an extensive collection of pieces, Spanx can be worn to formal events, the office, brunch, the gym (FYI: The brand also has a full line of activewear made of sweat-wicking fabric that's perfect for working out), and in the studio — basically wherever, whenever you want.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">How you wear your Spanx is completely up to you, but please don't feel like you&nbsp;need&nbsp;to wear shapewear to look your best. If wearing a smoothing undergarment makes you feel amazing and confident,&nbsp;great. If not, also great. Do&nbsp;you.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-wear></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Wear</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Spanx has a whole line of panties; in that case, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;underwear. However, if you're debating whether to wear something underneath&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Spanx's Shaper Shorts</a>, skip it. The whole point of shapewear is to create a seamless line underneath your clothes. Excess fabric will lead to excess bulk.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-care-instructions></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Care Instructions</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Items such as shapewear, swimwear, and tights should be hand-washed in cold water and then laid flat to dry. All other apparel and activewear can be machine washed on cold, then either air-dried or tumble-dried on low. When in doubt, look at the instructions on the label to ensure you're properly caring for that specific item.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x6iuZqyfqHypu9Zmq6hlp5qus3nSqZinsF2otaK8xLCcmqo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./come-back-visit-her-parrot-tears-flow-online-woman-china-22-weds-dying-love-life-spend-final-days.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Come back to visit her as a parrot: tears flow online as woman in China, 22, weds dying love o</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-masked-singer-miss-cleocatra-reveals-new-death-life-incident-says-it-made-me-the-hardest-hustler-1299129.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Masked Singer: Miss Cleocatra Reveals New-Death Life Incident; Says 'It Made Me The Hardest Hust</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
