For a time this woman summered at a hotel in Greenwich, Connecticut, and among her possessions there was a dusty old Mercedes that had been stashed in a warehouse, surrounded by old carnival equipment. "It's black," Gooding recalled the lawyer saying. "It's a convertible, and it's old."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"How old?" Gooding asked.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I don't know. But it has pipes coming out of the side."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2012/08/13/c665caab4a1722fe0653ac84c12e9d7d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This was no ordinary Mercedes. It turned out to be an exceedingly rare 1936 540K Special Roadster. Fewer than 10 such cars are said to survive in comparable condition, and Gooding, who is now the president of his own auction house, Gooding and Company, believes the completely restored roadster might set the record for the most expensive car ever sold at auction when his firm offloads it this month during the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. "We sold a Ferrari Testarossa last year for US$16 million," Gooding said, noting the last time he set a record. "If this car hits that number, it wouldn't surprise me."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Back in the early 1990s, Gooding failed to get the Mercedes consigned to Christie's, and eventually a private buyer swooped in. But now that same buyer is keen on selling, which means Gooding finally has his chance to bring the iconic roadster to the open market. "I've been chasing this car for a long time."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Much of the car's value is derived from its rarity and its condition - "every panel on this car is original," Gooding said It also came with a colourful provenance. It was purchased 76 years ago by the family of a Prussian baroness who might have been a character from an Alan Furst novel: she was elegant, coquettish, depressive, a dead ringer for Marlene Dietrich, who fancied jewels and lived in the best hotels in Paris and Cannes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This was the Baroness Gisela Josephine von Krieger. She was a society fixture in London, even attending the coronation of King George VI. She resided in France until 1938 and, after being summoned back to Nazi Germany, fled to Monaco, then Switzerland. The Mercedes, which was being repaired when war broke out, was shipped to her after she negotiated a Swiss visa by feigning an illness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/2012/08/13/733e63e6e415b1b4140544cae16b852c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the 1950s, von Krieger brought the roadster to New York, where she lived in hotels like the Waldorf-Astoria and the St. Regis. She left the car in the US when she returned to Switzerland in 1959. In subsequent decades she grew increasingly reclusive. In 1989, when she died of a heart attack, she was living in Havishamian squalor, with US$320,000 worth of jewels by Cartier and others - later auctioned off by Sotheby's - scattered around her filthy apartment. "She died alone. It was a tragic story," Gooding said. "When they discovered her body, she had been dead for some time." Her Mercedes Roadster, secreted away for four decades in Connecticut, proved to be the best custodian of von Krieger's glamorous legacy. When the car was found, the glove box contained a pair of the baroness' white silk gloves. In the ashtray were ancient cigarette butts, stained with lipstick.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: On the road again</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpqqpJ6wrbGOamdpcGhqf3C%2BzpqbZpmXlrav</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./winter-sun-holidays-short-flight-16837131.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Six winter sun destinations less than six hours flight away</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pink-opens-up-handsome-husband-carey-hart.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pink opens up about her marriage with 'handsome' husband Carey Hart</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
