average, primarily for commuting to work, Sawatzky, a teacher in Beijing, said he was saving a lot of money on taxi fares after buying a 3,300-yuan (HK$4,190) scooter and would be willing to spend more on a bike.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">We want to make something with better quality so it costs more, but they are reliableNATHAN SIY, ELECTROFORCE CO-FOUNDER</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"If I would buy a new electric bike, I would probably spend no more than 10,000 yuan," he said, adding that he expected some people to be willing to pay even more for better performance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Li Bin, secretary general of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers' motorcycle section, said demand for high-performance motorcycles had been rising for a decade.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"For example, sales of Harley-Davidson saw growth multiply in Beijing over the past few years," Li said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Harley-Davidson, a motorcycle maker in the United States that entered China in 2005, said its annual sales on the mainland had doubled since 2006.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, the current ban on riding motorcycles on highways and major thoroughfares in large cities due to safety and pollution concerns had limited their use, Li said, even though they were a good way to ease traffic congestion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although high-performance electric motorcycles could be a good alternative for riders of petrol motorcycles, Li said there was a lack of product diversity, with most mainland manufactures too focused on making low-priced models targeting the mass market.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Actually, we see increasing numbers of electric motorcycle clubs gathering riders of high-performance bikes for leisure and travelling," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Electric two-wheelers can be divided into two categories - power-assisted bicycles and motorcycles or scooters with electric motors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The mainland was the world's largest manufacturer and exporter of electric two-wheelers, accounting for 92 per cent of the global market in 2012, research and consulting firm Pike Research said. The output in 2012 was 36 million units, up 26.3 per cent from the previous year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">ElectroForce Motors, a start-up founded by three engineers last year, is pinning its hopes on the niche market for high-performance electric motorcycles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"In Beijing, there are a lot of inexpensive bikes, but the problem is quality," said Nathan Siy, one of the founders.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company has designed two models, a "street fighter" e-motorcycle and a sports e-motorcycle, which are priced between US$4,200 and US$5,000.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A salesman at Xinri E-Vehicle, a dealer for electric bikes in Beijing, said the most popular electric two-wheelers were scooters priced at about 3,000 yuan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Electric bikes at that price level are equipped with a 20Ah battery, which is sufficient for riding 50 kilometres per charge, and that's good enough for daily commuting," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">High-priced models were rare as only a very few bikes priced at more than 10,000 yuan were sold in an average month, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Siy said high-performance electric motorcycles were rare in Beijing, but there was a niche group of people who could be potential buyers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said the bikes were at a mid-level price point.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We want to make something with better quality so it costs more, but they are reliable and safe," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Siy also said ElectroForce's bikes would be launched in March with test rides in Beijing and Shanghai.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company is currently working with a few Beijing electric bike dealers. Siy said things were moving slowly, but he remained confident.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"There are a lot of people who actually have motorcycles and spend upwards of 30,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan on them," he said. "I think there is a great opportunity for us to bring over people from the motorcycle community into the electric bike community."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Starting in Beijing made sense because the company could source parts and components from all around the country, said Brandon Ng, another founder of ElectroForce.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the meantime, the company is looking to set up distribution channels overseas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We hope to start in Asia first - China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, all great motorcycle places with big populations of riders," Ng said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company has already lined up distributors in Brazil and Indonesia.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Ride the mainland boom in electric bikes</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfmLWqusBmma6rmaOytL%2BOmqmtoZOhsnB9knJvb3BoZL%2BqsMRmmqGhnpZ6o7vOpmSepJWYwbO1wmaZoqOVqA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./big-pokey-cause-of-death-heart-attack-texas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Big Pokey Cause Of Death Revealed, SUC Rapper Died Of Heart Attack</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-middleton-engagement-ring-cost.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Middleton's engagement ring: 'everyone wants to copy her'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
