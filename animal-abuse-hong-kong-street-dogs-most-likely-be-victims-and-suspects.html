Laws stipulate prosecutors cannot lay charges in the lower courts against people suspected of animal abuse more than six months after the alleged offence occurred. The new study found that in 20 per cent of cases, owners who abandoned animals avoided prosecution because they could not be located within the six-month window.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/22/b39c33c3-6d23-4e72-b0cf-934f61d1671c_bc3dd932.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The HKU/SPCA report called for a number of changes: a need for duty of care for animals to be introduced to complement current anti-cruelty legislation; regulations to control grooming parlours, animal trainers and pet boarding facilities; and improved regulations to deter animal poisoners.</p>It also called for better regulation of the use of traps as well as prohibitions on <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">so-called mercy release</span></a>, the practice of freeing captured animals into the wild commonly carried out by Buddhists who believe the act brings good karma.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The study also turned the spotlight on unregulated animal shelters, calling for the urgent introduction of shelter licensing legislation. A further reason to regulate animal rescue shelters, it said, is the lack of financial transparency as to how public donations are being used.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/22/3e30498b-6998-4f63-8f35-13284ae70dcb_af345436.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fiona Woodhouse, deputy director of welfare at SPCA (HK), who worked on the study, cites the case of a woman running a shelter with volunteers who had confined 95 dogs in a village house and yard.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The dogs had not been fed for a very long time and 20 of them died,” says Woodhouse, adding some of the bodies were eaten by other starving dogs.
