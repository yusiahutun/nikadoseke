The <a href=#>gripping storyteller</a> and <a href=#>strategic villain</a> figures out where money is made and he makes it. Born in Queens in 1975 to a 15-year-old mother, he came into a very specific set of skills necessary to thrive under cutthroat capitalism. His mother, Sabrina, whom he once described as “man-tough,” was a street-level dealer who plied him with jewelry before she died under mysterious circumstances when he was 8. He went to live with his loving grandparents, where he played good boy at home while rising as a hustler on the streets. By the time he was in his late teens, he had two luxury cars, guns, gear, and a small army of employees — but no easy way out.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clilymgmb002b3b6vuikhpbj1@published data-word-count=214>Providence arrived when Run-D.M.C.’s <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-1 tabindex=0>DJ Jam Master Jay,</span> while working as a producer in the ’90s, taught 50 how to make songs and connected him to the music industry. That led to a deal with Columbia Records — one that famously fell apart when Jackson narrowly survived being shot nine times outside his grandmother’s house in 2000 shortly before his debut album, Power of the Dollar, was set to be released. A bullet to the jaw gave him a distinct tight-lipped slur, making every word he rapped sound like a threat. His label unceremoniously dropped him, but his street legend approached superhero status. He immediately flooded the market with a series of self-made mixtapes, peddling his tale of riches and woes and building both an audience and a mystique. Those tapes landed him a new record deal in 2002 with <a href=#>Eminem</a>’s company, <a href=#>Shady Records</a>, and his first studio release, <a href=#>Get Rich or Die Tryin’,</a> became one of the biggest-selling debuts in hip-hop history and the soundtrack at weddings, clubs, and birthday parties for the next 20 years. He has since released five studio albums, founded two film-and-television production companies, and kept himself in the news, for better or worse, by beefing with everyone from <a href=#>Ja Rule</a> to Oprah to Vanderpump Rules star <a href=#>Randall Emmett</a>.</p><h2 class=package-toc-header>In This Issue</h2><h2 class="package-toc-headline hidden">Drew Barrymore Lights Up Daytime</h2><h4 class=package-toc-teaser data-editable=teaser></h4><ul id=packageList_UpnJHy45 class=package-list-items><span class=svg-include></span><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-table-of-contents data-track-headline="Drew Barrymore Is Figuring It Out Live" data-track-page-uri=https://www.vulture.com/article/drew-barrymore-show-profile.html data-track-index=0 data-track-component-title="Package Table of Contents - Drew Barrymore Lights Up Daytime"><a class="item-link item-text" href=#><span class=package-text>Drew Barrymore Is Figuring It Out Live</span></a></li><span class=svg-include></span><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-table-of-contents data-track-headline="The Binge Purge: TV’s Streaming Model Is Broken" data-track-page-uri=https://www.vulture.com/2023/06/streaming-industry-netflix-max-disney-hulu-apple-tv-prime-video-peacock-paramount.html data-track-index=1 data-track-component-title="Package Table of Contents - Drew Barrymore Lights Up Daytime"><a class="item-link item-text" href=#><span class=package-text>The Binge Purge: TV’s Streaming Model Is Broken</span></a></li><span class=svg-include></span><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-table-of-contents data-track-headline="Who’s Winning the Streaming Wars Now?" data-track-page-uri=https://vulture.com/article/streaming-power-ranking-2023.html data-track-index=2 data-track-component-title="Package Table of Contents - Drew Barrymore Lights Up Daytime"><a class="item-link item-text" href=#><span class=package-text>Who’s Winning the Streaming Wars Now?</span></a></li><span class=svg-include></span><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-table-of-contents data-track-headline="The Simpsons&nbsp;Is Good Again" data-track-page-uri=https://www.vulture.com/article/the-simpsons-is-good-again.html data-track-index=3 data-track-component-title="Package Table of Contents - Drew Barrymore Lights Up Daytime"><a class="item-link item-text" href=#><span class=package-text>The Simpsons&nbsp;Is Good Again</span></a></li><span class=svg-include></span><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-table-of-contents data-track-headline="In Taylor Sheridan’s America, the Cowboy Is Colonized Too" data-track-page-uri=https://www.vulture.com/article/taylor-sheridan-yellowstone-politics.html data-track-index=4 data-track-component-title="Package Table of Contents - Drew Barrymore Lights Up Daytime"><a class="item-link item-text" href=#><span class=package-text>In Taylor Sheridan’s America, the Cowboy Is Colonized Too</span></a></li></ul><span class=package-link-wrapper><a class=package-link href=#>More From the TV Issue</a>&nbsp;</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clilymgpv002d3b6vqqlaf791@published data-word-count=186>He transferred to TV the drug sagas he told and sold on his records, and in the mid-2010s, he co-created the show Power for Starz with writer and producer Courtney Kemp; he also launched BMF, the scripted Starz series based on the real-life Black organized-crime outfit run by two Detroit brothers.

It’s so difficult to get people to agree on things. You’ve got Democrats, you’ve got Republicans. It’s very rare that you can get these people to agree on stuff.

Or was that something you learned over time?<br></strong>I hustled my way into the music business. When I met Jam Master Jay,1 I already had a 400 SE Benz. I was right at the peak point of what you could have in my neighborhood selling drugs. I started telling him I wanted to rap. Then he gave me a tape with beats, and I went and wrote to it. He was like, “Yo, where the hook?” I’m like, “It’s right there.” He’s like, “That ain’t a hook.” And he taught me how to count bars. I was forced to write the chorus multiple times before I could rap. Because in Jam Master Jay’s head, he was like, Anybody can rap. You’ve got to get the song structure together. Some guys could come up with punch lines and it’s lyrical, but they can’t necessarily write a song to save their lives. Their music is so much better than everybody else’s that nobody buys it. But the money is in writing the right songs. So that was way more important to me for my entire career.<strong></strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clilymhc0002i3b6v14fsje7e@published data-word-count=53>I think if you’re in the music business, if you put business in front of music, you’re handling things the right way.
