"Once they got done fighting, [the other girl], was like, 'I got something for you all," said Deaira.</p><p>That "something", prosecutors say, was acid.</p><p>"Her mother met her in the park, by the park and gave her the substance, the chemical, to throw on the kids," Dominique alleged. "And she told the kids, that's what they get for messing with her daughter."</p><p>Though Deaira and her family say they made a run for it, she realized she had forgotten her purse and went back to retrieve it. That's when prosecutors say the child -- who they called a "bystander" -- was "doused with acid" by the 12-year-old.</p><p>"Two seconds after it hit me, it just started burning," the child recalled, as her mom said "Smoke was coming off her body from head to toe and holes were coming in her clothes."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4864db8a-e279-47cf-bc9d-013e99400a62 data-container-ref=toofab:article:1d066a53-4626-430c-a2dc-3811c075f1aa data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/07/5by4/2023/07/17/0738b84e3f274532a107590f0ee697b9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook/Clermont County Sheriff’s Office</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">New Docs Detail How Dad Allegedly Executed Three Sons Amid Wife & Daughter's Attempts to Stop Him</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Summers said her back, arms and legs are covered in second and third degree burns, which can be seen in the video report above. According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>GoFundMe</strong></a> page set up by her godmother, the child spent four days in the hospital and is "lucky to be alive" after the attack. She now has trouble walking and, according to her mom, it now "takes maybe two hours what used to be 20 minutes getting dressed."</p><p>According to Wayne County Prosecutors, the suspect was ordered to have no contact with the victim or witnesses and will appear in court this afternoon. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>People</strong></a>, the prosecutor's office said police are investigating whether an adult will be charged in connection to the case.</p><p>“Whoever was involved with her, I would like them all to be arrested for what they did to my daughter," Dominique told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>WXYZ</strong></a>. "I hope she get what she deserve, and they all get what they deserve."</p><p>"This is an extremely troubling set of allegations. Instant horrible decision making can have lifelong effects on others," said Prosecutor Kym Worthy. "There is no excuse for this."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2fadf97c-4d17-4f22-977c-b6ccbe047744 data-container-ref=toofab:article:1d066a53-4626-430c-a2dc-3811c075f1aa data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/24/5by4/2023/07/17/24461073c5d34846ae13b105b7f92a2a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Suffolk County Sheriff's Office</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">TikToker Claims 'Creepy' Gilgo Beach Murder Suspect Spoke with Her About Killings, Shares Voicemail Online</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3BmanBfZn9uxcSaqWannJl6pLTAq56enF2WsKqwjJqrrZmToHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./berniece-julien.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Berniece Julien Bio, Wiki, Height, Husband &amp;amp; Divorce</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kenneth-petty.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Nicki Minaj's Husband Kenneth Petty?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
