After Queen Elizabeth’s death, William’s father ascended to the throne as King Charles III, and William and his wife Kate were then named Prince and Princess of Wales—titles formerly held by his father and his mother Princess Diana respectively.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/prince-william-kate-middleton-conspiracy-theories.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/king-charles-medical-records.jpg><p>So with more than 20 years of romance, what are Prince William and Kate’s Valentine’s gifts to each other? Read more to find out.</p><h2>What did William give Kate for Valentine’s Day 2023?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kate-william.jpg><p>What did William give Kate for Valentine’s Day? It still might be a big surprise. Kate visited Leeds on February 1, 2023, as part of her initiative for The Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood and promoted the kickoff of her new <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Shaping Us </a>campaign, raising awareness of the importance of a child’s first five years of life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When visiting the Leeds Kirkgate Market, Kate talked to florist Neil Ashcroft who asked the Princess of Wales about her Valentine’s Day plans. Ashcroft asked, “No doubt William will be buying you some red roses?” According to the florist, Princess Kate replied, “I don’t think he will do.” Ashcroft then added, “I offered her a discount. I said I would give her a card and knock off the VAT [tax].” He also said that the Princess of Wales “acted very genuine.” Kate also has a history with the city of Leeds since her father is from the city and has a long family history coming from the Middletons.</p><p>It’s the total opposite of what happened last year, but it could be part of their daily routine. The Prince of Wales gave his wife a sweet romantic gesture for the<a href=# rel=noopener> day of love</a>. “William surprised Kate with a huge box of 50 roses on Valentine’s Day,” a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> on February 16, 2022. “He handwrote the most romantic message in his card, praising her for being such a wonderful wife and mother.” In addition to the Duke of Cambridge’s heartfelt gift for his wife, Duchess Kate also received “handmade Valentine’s cards” from their kids, according to Us Weekly’s source. &nbsp;After being together for 20 years, they tend to keep things less “extravagant” on Valentine’s Day—but that doesn’t mean their celebration was any less enjoyable. According to Us Weekly’s insider, it’s all about enjoying life’s “simple” pleasures for this couple. “William and Kate are homebodies, so their date nights tend to be chill,” the source told the site. “They’ll watch Netflix and documentaries when the children are in bed, order takeout, play Scrabble and enjoy a few glasses of wine. For them, it’s the simple things in life that count.”</p><p>She posted about her Shaping Us campaign on a new <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram account.</a> “Our early childhood, the time from pregnancy to the age of five, fundamentally shapes the rest of our lives,” she said in a video. “But as a society, we currently spend much more of our time and energy on later life. Today, the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood is launching a new campaign, Shaping Us, to raise awareness of the life-changing impact we can have when we build a supportive, nurturing world around children and those who care for them.”</p><p>The Valentine’s Day plans came months after Kate hosted her second caroling event during <a href=# rel=noopener>Christmastime</a> at the historic church called “Together at Christmas.” The caroling event featured the Westminster Abbey Choir performing world-famous Christmas carols, including “O Come, All Ye Faithful,” which was selected through a public poll. Musical guests also on the special broadcast, including Craig David, Alexis French, Samantha Barks and a duet by Alfie Boe and Melanie C. It also featured readings by Prince William, Dame Kristin Scott Thomas and Hugh Bonneville. The special began with a video tribute that looked back at Queen Elizabeth’s meaningful Christmas Day messages over the years. Prince William read her 2012 Christmas broadcast speech during the event, and Kate honored Her Majesty with Paddington Bear tributes at the ceremony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Spare-by-Prince-Harry.jpeg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$23.12</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$36.00</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>36% Off</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>For more about Prince Harry, read his upcoming memoir, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span class=s2><i>Spare</i></span></a>. Told for the first time in his own words, the book takes readers through the Duke of Sussex’s life with the British royal family, from the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997 to how the moment led to his decision decades later to move to America with his wife, Meghan Markle, and leave Buckingham Palace for good in 2020. “With its raw, unflinching honesty, <i>Spare</i> is a landmark publication full of insight, revelation, self-examination, and hard-won wisdom about the eternal power of love over grief,” the publisher’s description reads.</span></p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
