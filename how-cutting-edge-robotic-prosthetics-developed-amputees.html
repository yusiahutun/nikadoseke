Herr and Carty replaced it with their newly designed prosthetic limb. Ewing says it is almost as controllable as his organic limb was, and feels very similar.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A new film, Augmented, documents Herr’s journey – he received two prosthetic limbs when his feet were amputated after he got lost during a climbing expedition – and that of Ewing and Carty.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Anything is possible’ for inspirational Dave Mackey, despite amputation</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s a fascinating story which shows how Herr, who originally had no desire to be a medical engineer, devoted his life to developing better prosthetic limbs when he became dissatisfied with the plaster-of-Paris limbs he was given after his own double amputation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Herr was not motivated wholly by a desire to help himself, although that was part of it. He had vowed to do something positive with his life because a young rescuer had died while searching for him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He became obsessed with the idea of making more effective limbs for people – his motivation for studying medical technology.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Herr adapted his original prosthetic limbs to make it easier for him to climb rock faces: he would switch between short limbs and very long ones for different types of climb, and also switch his man-made feet around.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This has made him an evangelist for body augmentation. He believes that prosthetic limbs need not only be used to “fix” damaged ones, but could actually be given to healthy people to improve their performance in certain activities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is no ‘normal’ condition for the human body,” Herr says in the film. “If we can feel our legs and they are motorised, we will be cyborgs. In the future it will be considered an augmentation – we will be better with these new limbs.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Speaking at a recent webinar hosted by health, medicine, and life sciences media company Stat, Carty says the 2013 Boston Marathon terrorist bombings – as a result of which some of the victims underwent amputation – crystallised his collaboration with Herr.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such teamwork between surgeons and medical engineers is surprisingly rare, Carty notes. “You would think that these kinds of conversations take place all the time, but historically, surgical management of patients like Jim [Ewing] has existed entirely separately from the prosthetists.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But here, the development of the technology informed the surgical procedure, and conversely, the evolution of the surgical procedure informed how the technology was developed,” Carty said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/27/bf0efefb-b81e-41ff-a907-88cd7aa855e3_1b91039b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their main aim was to restore the sense of proprioception – a person’s awareness of their body’s movement and location – to the artificial limb wearer. It tells you how your joints are moving, how fast they are moving, and how hard they are pushing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Without proprioception, it’s difficult to perform actions like walking without thinking about what you are doing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Proprioception depends on mechano-sensory receptors in joints, muscles and tendons. Amputees cannot experience proprioception in their prosthetic limbs, as the connections that are necessary to enable it are not made. The brain does receive some information, but the messages are confusing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/27/bce353e4-59f6-45d0-815e-f135df2a77c4_ac205fc3.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is a disharmonic relationship,” Carty said. “Patients may perceive the position of their limb in space, but it’s discombobulated, it’s not anatomically correct.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Herr and Carty decided to optimise the limb that needed amputation so proprioception could be restored through advanced engineering.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The aim was “to enable a seamless integration between electrobiology and human physiology”, Herr says. Essentially, the Ewing Amputation preserves normal signalling between the muscles and the brain, so amputees feel like they are controlling their prosthetic limb naturally.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The key part of the technique is restoring the “agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI)”, which is the way that muscles on the back and front of an arm or leg work together to send a reading of physical space to the brain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The muscles interact like an internal pulley system in the arm, but they are severed in an amputation,” Carty said. In a Ewing Amputation, the push-pull dynamics of the muscle relationship are restored through robotic engineering, and information is collected through electrodes and decoded by the brain and body.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ewing said his body adapted quickly to the new prosthetic, and he used it without thinking about it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/27/352727dd-c867-4373-a05e-5ceb65b1ea3b_b2ede5c4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My brain felt that my foot was still there, and used the muscles accordingly,” he said, noting that his body seems to have developed a strong attachment to the prosthetic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s brain control in the sense that your body is controlling [the prosthetic limb] in the same way you control your intact limbs,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ewing said the pain he used to feel in his stump – which was sometimes excruciating – subsided after he was fitted with the new prosthetic. Now he just gets some minor pain from wearing the actual device.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The first woman amputee to summit Everest shares her story</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He has no trouble walking up stairs without thinking about where his foot is – and has even resumed rock climbing. Using his prosthetic limb, he revisited the rock face where he got his injury and climbed it successfully.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Carty says that the procedure has been applied to 34 limbs on 30 patients, and there is now probably enough evidence to prove that it is safe to move out of research and into general use.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are hoping this will be the standard way of doing amputations, and will be available to people worldwide,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/27/ef6ad9aa-897b-44d8-8ea5-29ba32658b44_78dbec7d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Herr, meanwhile, has taken to pushing the idea of cyborgs in venues like TedX talks. He still uses standard prosthetics rather than those he co-designed, but he believes that healthy people could benefit from choosing to have amputations to better fit themselves for specific tasks, something that he describes as “augmentation”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Normalcy is not the pinnacle,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ewing, however, says it would be ridiculous to have an amputation that was not medically necessary.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese scientists’ robot fish could pave way for low-cost prosthetics</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Being an amputee is inconvenient,” he says. “For instance, getting up to go to the bathroom in the night – you have to crawl across the floor to the bathroom,” he said. “You’d have to be a fool.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2avlaG5r7HSrGaaqqSesK2xjmxocHFkZYFwtM6wZJytpKm2r7OMnpugnV2nvKO706KaZqiipMC1tMStoJyrXZmyt7HLqKeenF2WurHB056crA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-hudson-divides-fans-lips.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Hudson divides fans as she debuts new lips but it's not what you think</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./black-chicago-mayor-johnson-replace-migrant-reparations-property-tax-white-asian-hispanic-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Black Chicagoans slam Mayor Johnson for 'replacing' them with migrants, demanding 'REPARATIONS' carv</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
