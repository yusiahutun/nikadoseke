In Avengers: Age of Ultron, Olsen starred as one of the two Maximoff twins (Aaron Taylor-Johnson played her brother, Pietro/Quicksilver.) As Hydra test subjects, both Wanda and Pietro have superpowers. Pietro has the power of superspeed, while Wanda has telepathic and telekinetic abilities.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Though (spoiler alert!) Pietro dies at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Wanda went on to live in the MCU. After Avengers: Age of Ultron, Olsen starred in several more MCU films, including 2016’s Captain America: Civil War, 2018’s Avengers: Infinity War and 2019’s Avengers: Endgame. She also stars alongside Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange in 2022’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.</p><p>In January 2021, Olsen starred as Wanda in <a href=# rel=noopener>Marvel’s first TV series</a> on Disney+: <a href=# rel=noopener><a href=# id=auto-tag_wandavision data-tag=wandavision>WandaVision</a></a>. The show, which also stars Paul Bettany’s Vision, follows Wanda and Vision as they live in the suburbs of a town called WestView, as they try to hide their powers. She earned her first-ever Emmy nomination for the role in July 2021. Though she confirmed there won’t be a <a href=# rel=noopener>WandaVision season 2</a>, she still appreciates the series for its deep dive on the character.</p><p>“I never thought I would have this opportunity, and I am so grateful to get to have spent this many hours with her now. I feel like I can do anything with her now,” she said. “Someone I was talking to was saying that’s what is so interesting about the character is you don’t know if she’s a hero or a villain — and that’s kind of the point of that character in the comics. You can’t define her as either. The only person that can hurt her is herself. I just love getting to play her because of those complexities.”</p><p>Of course, Olsen’s career doesn’t only include her MCU projects. From indie films like Marcy Marcy May Marlene and Ingrid Goes West to blockbusters like Godzilla. Olsen is also no stranger to <a href=# id=auto-tag_tv data-tag=tv>TV</a>, having starred in Facebook Watch’s Sorry For Your Loss, which she also served as an executive producer on. Ahead is what we know about <a href=# rel=noopener>Elizabeth Olsen’s net worth</a>.</p><h2>How much does Elizabeth Olsen make as Scarlet Witch?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Doctor-Strange-in-the-Multiverse-of-Madness-3-2.jpg><p>How much does <a href=# id=auto-tag_elizabeth-olsen data-tag=elizabeth-olsen>Elizabeth Olsen</a> make as Scarlet Witch? Olsen’s salary as Scarlet Witch hasn’t been confirmed, but it’s assumed that it’s at least in the even figures.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter </a>reported in 2019 that Olsen’s Marvel Cinematic Universe co-stars, that Chris Hemsworth (who plays Thor), Chris Evans (who plays Steve Rogers / Captain America) and <a href=# rel=noopener>Scarlett Johansson</a> (who plays Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow) made $15 million each for Avengers: Infinity War and another $15 million for Avengers: Endgame. The other two original Avengers actors, Jeremy Renner (who plays Clint Barton / Hawkeye) and Mark Ruffalo (who plays Bruce Banner / Hulk), were likely also paid the same salary. The last original Avengers actor, Robert Downey Jr. (who plays Iron Man), was paid $50 million for each Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, though some reports claim that he made $200 million for each movie, which would’ve paid him $400 million in total. Given that Doctor Strange is a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Phase 3, it’s likely that Cumberbatch made around the same as <a href=# rel=noopener>Tom Holland</a> (who plays Peter Parker / Spider-Man) for Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Holland made $3 million for each for Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, which paid him $6 million in total for both movies.</p><p>According to THR, Olsen, as well as Paul Bettany (Vision), Anthony Mackie (Falcon), Sebastian Stan (Winter Soldier) and Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) negotiated deals separate from their movie contracts for their Disney Plus series, which are between six to eight episodes. Olsen and Bettany star in WandaVision, while Mackie and Stan star in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Renner stars in Hawkeye.</p><p>According to Puck News, a newsletter created by former Hollywood Reporter editor Matthew Beloni, Olsen’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness co-star, Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Doctor Strange, made $7.5 million for the Doctor Strange sequel after making $5.5 million for the original Doctor Strange. In 2016, <a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a> reported that Doctor Strange was the “biggest single-character introduction in the Marvel Cinematic Universe” and had made more than movies like 2008’s Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk; 2011’s Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger; and 2015’s Ant-Man. Doctor Strange was also ranked 11th on Deadline’s 2016 list of the “Most Valuable Blockbusters.” According to Boxoffice Pro, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is expected to earn between $190 million to $210 million in the United States and Canada on its opening weekend, with a total domestic gross of $450 million to $560 million.</p><p>If Olsen’s salary is in the seven figures, it’s still a a lot more than what most Marvel Cinematic Universe actors made for the first MCU movies. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Business Insider</a>, Chris Evans, who plays Steve Rogers / Captain America, made $1 million for 2011’s Captain America: The First Avenger, while Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor, made $150,000 for 2011’s Thor. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Tony Stark / Iron Man, made $500,000 for 2008’s Iron Man. <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a> also reported that Chadwick Boseman, who played T’Challa / Black Panther, made $2 million for 2018’s Black Panther, while Brie Larson, who played Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel, made $5 million for 2019’s Captain Marvel. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Daily Mail</a>, Tom Holland, who plays Peter Parker / Spider-Man, made $500,000 for 2017’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, while Chris Pratt, who plays Peter Quinn / Star-Lord, made a “low seven figures” for 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a>.</p><h2>What is Elizabeth Olsen’s net worth?</h2><p>The question Marvel fans want to know: What is Elizabeth Olsen’s net worth? Well, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Olsen is worth a massive $11 million. (Her WandaVision costar, Paul Bettany, in comparison, is worth $50 million, while <a href=# rel=noopener>Benedict Cumberbatch</a> is worth $40 million.) Most of Olsen’s net worth is expected to come from Marvel projects like WandaVision, <a href=# rel=noopener>Avengers: Endgame</a> and Captain America: Civil War. However, Olsen also has an executive producer credit in Facebook Watch’s Sorry For Your Loss, which is sure to bring in tons of cash in addition to the salary she’s paid to star in the series.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>WandaVision</a> is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Disney Plus</a>.
