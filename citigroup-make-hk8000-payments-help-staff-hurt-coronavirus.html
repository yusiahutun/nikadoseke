It is part of the bank’s <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">announcement</span></a> last week of <span class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-3>one-time payments to 75,000 staff globally, including US$1,000 each to its lowest-paid workers in the US.</span><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This initiative is for colleagues who are more likely to face economic hardship in the current situation,” Angel Ng Yin-yee, Citi’s Hong Kong and Macau chief executive, said. “We hope that our support will help lighten their load as they cope with other challenges and family priorities during this time.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Citi joined other financial groups like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, who have offered special payments or incentives to help their employees weather the unprecedented crisis. They include allowing staff who are sick or unable to work time off without having to use their annual leave.</p>The health crisis has already inflicted a steep cost for lenders and investors alike, as bank stocks tumbled. Citigroup’s shares have lost 47 per cent this year. Both HSBC and Standard Chartered shares slumped on Wednesday after they greed to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">cancel their dividends and suspend share buy-backs</span></a> following a request by UK regulators.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 disease, has infected more than 844,000 people worldwide and forced governments from Hong Kong to the UK to urge businesses to allow staff to work away from offices to stem the spread. About 65 per cent of its staff in Hong Kong continue to work from home, Citi said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Months of street protests, followed by the coronavirus pandemic, have been stressful for front-line employees at a number of banks in Hong Kong prompting lenders to react. HSBC offered eligible local employees five extra days of annual leave to be taken between 2020 and 2021, apart from free meals in its canteens.</p>Like many governments across Asia, Hong Kong recently barred entry by non-residents, while returning residents <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">face a mandatory quarantine</span></a> and public gatherings have been limited to no more than four people.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Banks globally are facing pressure from policymakers to extend loans to businesses as the unprecedented global health crisis has stifled economic growth and led to millions of job losses worldwide.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Industry critics point to their performances following the global financial crisis in 2008 and the rich pay packages bank’s top executives have received in the intervening years.</p>HSBC said last week it would temporarily “pause” job cuts as part of its massive restructuring announced last month.
