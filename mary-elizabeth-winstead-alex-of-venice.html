It's kind of hard to find like an interesting complex female role in those worlds. Not to say they aren't great movies, but from time to time I kind of get rolled in to play the girlfriend if it's exciting enough. A lot of times, they end up being the thing I don't want to continue to do. My goal in a perfect world would be this movie to be a wide release.</p><p>toofab: As an actress, you ask yourself why smaller projects like “Alex of Venice” or “Smashed” don't get as much attention in the mainstream?</p><p>Mary: My husband is a director and most of our friends are indie filmmakers and that's kind of the world I live in. We spend a lot of time bitching about why people don't watch these films. But then I have to remind myself that I don't do it for the results of it. This movie was so much fun to make and I wouldn't take that back for the world. As long as I can find ways of doing what I love and making enough money to make it all work out, then that's what I want to keep doing. But yes, it does get frustrating.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/27/o/2015/04/16/2749dc4bfb055cc2a583057a46573386_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>toofab: What was it about this latest project that you loved?</p><p>Mary: I was kind of no brainer when I read it. It feels like a movie that I could've seen from the '70s or early '80s, back when these films were blockbusters, when stories about women trying to figure out their lives out was a really big deal. Those are the kinds of films I love and I was really excited to get to do something like that.</p><p>toofab: What was it like having Chris, as a first-time director?</p><p>Mary: He's probably the most giving in terms of like making you feel good about yourself then anyone else I have ever worked with. He's constantly telling you how great you are and how lucky he is to have you.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/33/o/2015/04/16/335522e2f2505bf5bc712f25eef3dbdb_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>toofab: Do you think his acting background had something to do with that?</p><p>Mary: I think so, in so many ways. I think his style focus on getting good performances and letting the actors breathe. I think having been on so many sets himself, he's learned a lot about what he likes and what he doesn't like as an actor and he was very aware of that.</p><p>“Alex of Venice” hits theaters and VOD April 17.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnZ7j21mam5foq6zxYyeo6KykZeytbSMsKCnq6SarqV5wKWcsWWfm3q3sc2imp5n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./keep-your-pcs-data-safe-using-create-synchronicity.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Keep Your PC's Data Safe Using Create Synchronicity</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./has-jessica-simpson-gone-even-darker.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Has Jessica Simpson Gone Even Darker?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
