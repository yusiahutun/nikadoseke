While the cosmetic surgery industry in the UK is currently worth around £3.6 billion, it's aesthetic treatments such as wrinkle-relaxing toxins and dermal fillers that account for 9 out of 10 procedures. Indeed, 13.6m non-surgical treatments were carried out worldwide in 2019 alone – a 50.6 per cent increase since 2015.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The quick, non-invasive nature of injectable tweakments, where a doctor or aesthetician inserts hyaluronic acid via a needle into specific contours of the face to manipulate its structure, has won a legion of fans over the years thanks to its (supposedly) natural result compared to going under the knife. But what happens when we become a little trigger-happy with the syringe? We get 'filler fatigue' – a term that's, unfortunately, being used more and more within the aesthetician industry as our quest for perfection becomes too much of a good thing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here, we ask the experts how to avoid filler fatigue and achieve the natural look so many desire.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>What is filler fatigue?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although the term suggests we're perhaps exhausted at the global obsession with fillers, it actually refers to what happens when hydrophilic filler draws in more water and creates a swollen-looking finish rather than the sculptured result intended. One person that is well versed with the term is cosmetic dental surgeon and advanced facial aesthetics clinician <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.facialsculpting.co.uk data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr Nina Bal" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr Nina Bal</a>. Appearing on E4's series Body Fixers, Dr Bal has seen her fair share of filler faux pas. “Sadly we are seeing more and more filler fatigue in recent times,” she says. “This is a result of patients having multiple millilitres of dermal filler injected and the area treated becoming augmented in a negative way. This may appear as puffiness, asymmetry, fullness to the area or even heaviness that was not previously there.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Without proper regulation, it's no wonder that the number of official complaints about non-surgical procedures has more than doubled to over 600 cases in the last three years, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.saveface.co.uk/about-us/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Save Face" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Save Face</a>, a national register of accredited practitioners. “The most common areas we are seeing this occur in clinic is the under eyes (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/a28828784/non-surgical-eye-bag-removal/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="tear trough" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">tear trough</a>), <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/a39365395/jaw-botox/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=jawline class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">jawline</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/a26622115/lip-fillers/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=lips class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">lips</a> and cheeks,” they say.<br></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>How to identify if you have filler fatigue</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Whether you're a dab hand in the aesthetician chair or a filler newbie, the fear of things going wrong is an unnerving reality. Although we've all heard the horror stories and seen the images of botched treatments, filler fatigue is more subtle in its appearance. “Anatomically, every patient will present differently,” Dr Bal explains. Despite the aim of looking rejuvenated or naturally refreshed, there are the undeniable artificial telltale signs of a treatment gone awry. “What I'm seeing is patients who have had jawline filler who feel their lower face looks heavier post treatment, or there's an increase in jowling and deeper nose-to-mouth lines. For those who have had their lips over-treated, they may find they have a ‘shelf’ above and below the lips, while those who have had their cheeks over-treated may see or feel a fullness in this area that's not in keeping with the rest of their face. If tear troughs are overfilled or the filler has been injected over the zygomatic ligament, this can result in a very unnatural swelling and puffiness under the eyes that make you look even more tired than having deep hollows.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Misuse of tear trough filler is especially concerning. "MRIs have been completed in patients who have had a treatment more than 10 years ago and it was found that many still had dermal filler present. These patients are presenting with chronic puffiness and poor lymphatic drainage of the area.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>What causes filler fatigue?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You've done your research and read the testimonials – but sometimes things just don't quite go to plan and, according to Dr Bal, the reason is two-fold. First, is mistreatment: “This is, for example, when a patient has been told that cheek or jawline filler will 'lift' their cheeks or jawline, which is incorrect,” she says. “Dermal filler does not have the ability to lift – it can contour an area to create the illusion of lifting but patients are having multiple millilitres of dermal filler injected repetitively in the hope of 'lifting' when this is simply not the best treatment option for the patient.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The second is over-treatment: “This refers more to patients who continually have the same treatment and the treating injector does not complete a thorough re-examination and re-consultation with the patient. We most often see this in the lips – where the patient has multiple treatments, and they start to lose the ‘anatomical’ shape of their lips.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The result? An over-inflated visage that's far from the balanced end result you were hoping for. Technique and restraint aside, experts are quick to warn that hydrophilic filler in particular is a significant player in filler fatigue. Popular brands such as Juvederm Ultra, for example, tend to draw in more water that's held in the filler molecules, migrating up to two centimetres from the injection site – leading to a lymphatic back-up and creating a more doughy finish.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for #SkinSchool: A guide to retinol" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/bd335e54-93e9-40ca-ba40-9a99ed1bc388/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1580825138_16637.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>How to avoid filler fatigue</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As tempting as it is to be lured in by a practitioner promising discounts, deals and specials, the reality is that filler is expensive to maintain and is not a treatment to scrimp on. “Dermal filler treatment carries risks, and we are luckily starting to move away from treating the areas as per the patient's request,” Dr Bal says. “It should be a very thoughtful, holistic and dynamic discussion between the patient and injector; rather than them asking for a certain amount of filler, the injector should be educating the patient on what the safest and best treatment recommendation to avoid filler fatigue is.” On the flip side, Dr Bal also believes that the patient should be choosing an injector who has a holistic approach to treatment and a deep understanding of the anatomy of the face and the long-term changes due to ageing that must be considered. Her best advice? It's a journey, not a race.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX6i4qrrCmqmeZ5FpfnSEknBscGeWnrmtsdFmnZqsmZzCpns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./model-gets-boyfriend-chores-having-25470283.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Model gets boyfriend to do chores by having sex with him and finds it empowering</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./501629-dalai-lama-outrage-boy-kiss-tongue-offers-apology.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dalai Lama Causes Outrage After Asking Boy to Kiss His Tongue, Offers Apology</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
