However, their birthday suggests otherwise. The likely reason is there is so much more to a person's astrological profile than their&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sun sign</a>; it also includes their rising sign (aka ascendant).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You could be missing out on crucial intel by reading the horoscope for your sun sign instead of your rising sign. So, to help you out, we've compiled a comprehensive guide that breaks down what a rising sign is, how to find it, and why it matters.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-a-rising-sign></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is a Rising Sign?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've never cast your&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>birth or natal chart</a>, you're missing out on pertinent details, including your rising sign. Once you know the precise time and location of your birth, you can create — via software, but it was traditionally done by hand — an accurate snapshot of the sky at the time of your birth. This will illustrate not only what signs the planets and luminaries (the sun and moon) were in when you were born but other info that offers even more insight into your astrological wiring, like houses, degrees, and aspects.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sign ascending on the eastern horizon at the time of your birth is considered your rising or ascendant. It speaks to the image you project out into the world — some say the mask you wear — and it offers insight into your skills, talents, and strategies you might adopt to make your way in life. Ever felt like people didn't initially perceive you as your sun sign? Perhaps that's because they were likely picking up on your rising sign.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Case in point: Say you were born on Dec. 17, so you've been told you're an unfiltered, truth-seeking, wanderlust-filled, fiery&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sagittarius</a>. However, your rising sign is social, conflict-averse cardinal air sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Libra</a>, so you come off as diplomatic, often trying to keep the peace at all costs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because it speaks to the external self, your ascendant can also affect your physical appearance. For example, Scorpio risings tend to have an intense, magnetic, mysterious vibe and a commanding — possibly even intimidating — presence. You could also enjoy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wearing darker colors</a>. On the other hand, Leo risings might pay special attention to their hair (manes, if you will), come off as effortlessly charismatic, and gravitate to bright, cheerful, golden hues.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It bears mentioning that the ascendant always lands in your first house, which is all about your brand. This includes the first impression you give people, the way you take the reins in life, how you first formed your self-image early in life, and your physical appearance.</p><p>Most horoscopes are written with a person's rising sign in mind. Once you know yours, the predictions for your rising might be more accurate than your sun (although it doesn't hurt to read both).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-figure-out-your-rising-sign></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Figure Out Your Rising Sign</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To identify your rising sign, you need your exact time of birth and place, which you should be able to find on your long-form birth certificate. This info is critical because the position of the horizon changes so often, and therefore, rising signs change quickly throughout the day — approximately every two hours. Only by having a precise time will you be able to get the most accurate rising sign.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you have your birth info, you can nail down your rising by casting your chart. You can do this on several free sites, such as&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>cafeastrology.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>astrology.com</a>, where you can plug in your info and receive your birth chart immediately. If you're hoping to zero in on your rising alone, Cafe Astrology also has a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>rising sign calculator</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-rising-sign-meanings-for-all-12-zodiac-signs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Rising Sign Meanings for All 12 Zodiac Signs</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Aries Rising</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because your ascendant is in the cardinal&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fire sign Aries</a>, ruled by aggressive Mars, action takes precedence over just about anything else.

It can also be tough for you to shift gears, preferring to stick with what you know — be that a place you've always lived, a long-term relationship you identify with, or a professional path you've been on since you were a kid.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Gemini Rising</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to your ascendant in mutable&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>air sign Gemini</a>, ruled by communicator Mercury, you come off as social, playful, and even impish, chatty, and quick-witted.
