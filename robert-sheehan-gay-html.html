His character Hargreeves — whose superhuman power is his ability to commune with the dead — is openly gay, and his siblings affectionately label him as “The Seance.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The actor had also played gay characters in several other projects, including Luba, a pan-sexual escort, in Netflix's&nbsp;Mute.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>And since he has represented queer characters on-screen, many fans have raised curiosity and taken to the internet pondering if the actor is gay in real life over the years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Addressing his fans’ queries and concerns, Sheehan sat down for a wide-ranging <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Hot Press magazine in October 2018. In the interview, he revealed that he did have experiences with men for the sake of knowing if he was sexually inclined towards men. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>I think it would be irresponsible not to question my sexuality. I had a couple of experiences when I was younger with dudes where I tried it, experimented, to see if it did anything for me.</p><p>However, the 'experiments' did not amount to anything.&nbsp;“And it [gay experiences] didn’t,” said the actor about whether the tryouts did anything for him.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>This statement solidifies the fact that he is not gay in real life. But he revealed more about his personal life that further confirmed&nbsp;his sexuality. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Sheehan also revealed&nbsp;he wasn't&nbsp;dating&nbsp;Sofia Boutella at the time, but they still maintained a good friendship. Boutella is an Algerian actress and model known for her roles in Atomic Blonde, Star Trek Beyond, and Kingsman. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Robert Sheehan and Sofia Boutella </strong>(Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pinterest</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>“We still love each other a lot. We still acknowledge that, you know,” the actor said.</p><p>The two had initially met on the set of the 2016’s thriller movie Jet Trash, where they co-starred and eventually started dating.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Getting back to his character in The Umbrella Academy, Sheehan <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spoke</a> with Digital Spy in 2019, hoping fans would look at Hargreeves beyond his sexuality. He said that a character’s other essence as a whole reduces with the labeling of sexuality. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Like it or not, if your character is labelled as a 'gay character', then that label becomes defining and it kind of reduces all else about the character. So you’re kind of doing the character a bit of a disservice.</p><p>He further added that Hargreeves wasn’t even introduced as gay or had any gay tendencies when they began the show. But the development of the story demanded the character to represent LGBTQ+.</p><p>He said, “[Klaus] wasn’t even gay when we began. Or he didn’t have gay tendencies when we began. But that sort of developed as we developed the character. It wasn’t always the way that it is.”</p><p>The 33-year-old actor has solidified his presence in the entertainment industry in a short time.&nbsp;Since making his debut in the early 2000s, he has appeared in notable projects such as Misfits, Love/Hate,&nbsp;Mortal Engines, and The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6e8o7HRrWSsoJWataK6jKCYsmaYqbqt</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ti-west.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ti West</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./miranda-lambert-luke-bryan-beach-it-festival.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Miranda Lambert, Luke Bryan, Thomas Rhett Lead Beach It!
