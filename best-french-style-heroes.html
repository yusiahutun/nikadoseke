Alexa Chung and Carly Simon consider her a style icon and Bob Dylan fell head over heels for her with no success; the enigmatic Françoise Hardy has beguiled both men and women alike with her melancholic sound and restrained bohemian style. Her look, which is as pervasive today as it was back in the 60s, was characterised by a blunt, thick fringe, shaggy fur coats, classic straight-leg jeans and streamlined mini dresses. She was also first to see the appeal in vinyl trench coats, and ankle boots.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">2</span><h2 class="css-1o97g4i eutn2uj7">Jeanne Damas</h2><img alt="French style icons" data-cy=slide-image-2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jeanne-damas-1553611585.jpg title="French style icons" width=2000 height=3000 fetchpriority=high priority decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Designer and influencer Jeanne Damas has long since said that our obsession with French style is less about clothes and more about the details - a certain way of tying a belt or a carefully chosen gold necklace. "It's about the way you wear your clothes, rather than what you’re actually wearing," <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a13035305/french-style-guide-for-winter-jeanne-damas/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she told us back in 2017" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">she told us back in 2017</a>. "I think French women tend to keep it simple. I'd say try the less-is-more approach, which is not always easy to get right.”</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a13035305/french-style-guide-for-winter-jeanne-damas/ data-vars-ga-call-to-action="READ DAMAS' STYLE GUIDE" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">READ DAMAS' STYLE GUIDE</a></p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">3</span><h2 class="css-1o97g4i eutn2uj7">Carine Roitfeld</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">French women tend to veer from bright pops of colour, a truth Carine Roitfeld tends to honour. The Harper's Bazaar global fashion director sticks to dark shades of navy, green and black, occasionally throwing on a leopard-print coat over the top. Texture plays a key role in Roitfeld's look - leather or vinyl skirts are teamed with sheer chiffon blouses or fine knit jumpers. Her timeless style inspired a collaboration with Uniqlo, where her signature pieces were sold to the masses - think black pencil skirts, towering heels, lace tights, fitted jackets and a sheer shirts.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">4</span><h2 class="css-1o97g4i eutn2uj7">Caroline de Maigret</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Caroline de Maigret brings androgyny to the classic Parisian aesthetic. Again, she knows what looks good on her and stays to true to that - by day, jeans, trainers and T-shirts worn with biker jackets or an oversized coat, and by night, high-waisted trousers, shirting and suit jackets, and - regardless of what time it is, messy hair. De Maigret isn't afraid to wear the same thing once - indeed she understands that the key pieces that you love the most are what creates a signature style.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">5</span><h2 class="css-1o97g4i eutn2uj7">Brigitte Bardot</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Brigitte Bardot was the ultimate French bombshell, and her influence still appears on catwalks today. Back in the 50s and 60s, she was the first to wear ballet pumps outside of dance studios, prompting Repetto to launch a style for alfresco use. Her look oscillated between kittenish femininity and overt sexiness, but she always purveyed an image of unabashed freedom. Her dishevelled blonde hair and black eyeliner were defining markers - a look that has long inspired Kate Moss.<br></p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">6</span><h2 class="css-1o97g4i eutn2uj7">Clémence Poésy</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Oversized knitwear and shirts, flats and skinny jeans make up Clémence Poésy's signature uniform. She doesn't think much of make-up and her hair follows the standard French girl déshabillé. On the red carpet, she'll team a floor-length gown with a pair of brogues, but really she's most at home in her grey Acne jeans and a T-shirt that she's customised to fit better. A Chanel muse and Chloé ambassador, Poésy is a bastion of pared-back Gallic effortlessness.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">7</span><h2 class="css-1o97g4i eutn2uj7">Juliette Gréco</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Legendary jazz singer Juliette Gréco impressed Jean-Paul Sartre with her poetic voice and wooed Miles Davies so much so that they fell in love. Muse to Paris' Left Bank in the 50s, Gréco was drinking partner to Orson Welles and party guest of Truman Capote. In 2014, Hedi Slimane shot her as his Saint Laurent campaign star. Her style is just as distinctive as her voice - a typically Beatnik look of a black roll neck and slim-cut black trousers, cropped above the ankle, and always kohl eyeliner.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">8</span><h2 class="css-1o97g4i eutn2uj7">Charlotte Gainsbourg</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There was little chance that Charlotte Gainsbourg wouldn't inherit style smarts given that her parents are the perennially chic Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg. The actress and singer adopts a low-key rock 'n' roll-inspired approach to fashion - skinny jeans, T-shirts, leather jackets, tennis shoes and skinny scarves form her daytime wardrobe, while she amps it up by night with leather mini skirts, ankle boots and simple T-shirts, occasionally choosing an sequinned mini dress again paired with boots. It's little wonder that she plays muse to Louis Vuitton's Nicolas Ghesquière and Saint Laurent's Anthony Vaccarello.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">9</span><h2 class="css-1o97g4i eutn2uj7">Coco Chanel</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's difficult to imagine what the fashion landscape would look like without Coco Chanel. If one of the prerequisites of French style is comfort and freedom of movement, Chanel was a pioneer, liberating women from the corseted silhouettes of old. It was she who - through both her eponymous brand and personal style - introduced a more relaxed, sporty femininity. The designer herself was a keen sportswoman (she loved sailing and horse-riding), and wanted to wear clothes she could move in, spanning trousers, slouchy breton tops and fisherman knits. Just one look at this picture of her taken in 1930 in a timelessly elegant ensemble proves how ahead of the game she was.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/designers/a743/coco-chanel-secret-life/ data-vars-ga-call-to-action="READ ABOUT CHANEL'S SECRET LIFE" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">READ ABOUT CHANEL'S SECRET LIFE</a></p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">10</span><h2 class="css-1o97g4i eutn2uj7">Vanessa Paradis</h2><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Vanessa Paradis' gamine look has remained a constant since she first became famous aged 14 with the success of song Joe le Taxi. Hers is an aesthetic underpinned by classics - skinny jeans, ankle boots, slouchy T-shirts and androgynous wool coats. She has always loved vintage, particularly pieces infused with bohemia, from embroidered jackets to men's waistcoats. As a long-standing Chanel muse, she counts the brand among her favourites, turning to Antik Batik for more hippie-inspired items.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmS0c4KYbWxvb2Zkr6a%2F02adq52emLVuv9Oyo55lmJq%2FsLHSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gwyneth-paltrow-nearly-died-delivering-daughter-apple-martin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gwyneth Paltrow Shares Scary Experience Giving Birth to Daughter Apple Martin: We Almost Died</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bingham-hawn-bellamy.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bingham Hawn Bellamy Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
