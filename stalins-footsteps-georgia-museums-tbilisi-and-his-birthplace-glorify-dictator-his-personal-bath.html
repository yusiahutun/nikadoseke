class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Stalinist sympathisers live on even though the current Russian occupation of 20 per cent of Georgia’s territory is all too reminiscent of the invasion of 1921 that made the country an unwilling part of the Soviet Union for 70 years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Stalin will never be forgotten, and the museum to his memory, on Gori’s Stalin Avenue, remains that city’s principal attraction.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text

cost</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But most visits to Georgia begin in Tbilisi, with its appealing mixture of elegant and dignified neoclassicism, post-Soviet modernity and ancient, frescoed churches.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All speak of the candidate European Union-member’s pro-European sensibility, as do EU flags flying outside public buildings and hanging from the balconies of private flats.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, in the ramshackle warren of a low-rise suburb, large gates painted with the Soviet Union’s hammer-and-sickle emblem mark the entrance to the little-visited but fascinating Underground Printing House Museum, which is effectively a shrine to Stalin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/26/2db6c4dc-e735-41f8-9ed8-11e87c39dfa2_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to a slightly confused account in the museum’s English handout, in 1893, revolutionaries obtained a printing press in Augsburg, Germany, then had it dismantled and secretly shipped to Tbilisi piece by piece.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Each part was lowered down a functioning well, carried along a short horizontal passage and hoisted up another, dry shaft to a hidden chamber beneath a small house in what was then still open countryside, although this wasn’t built until 1903.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/26/d20496ce-6a5c-49c2-a9ab-7f20006c79c3_31e6271f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is claimed that the young Stalin, whose official birth year is given as 1879 but was, in fact, a year earlier, worked here between 1903 and 1906. He and his comrades produced anti-tsarist and pro-communist propaganda in Armenian, Georgian and Russian, of a quality that attracted the attention of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin himself, then exiled in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Stalin’s biographer Simon Sebag Montefiore has his subject partly in Siberian exile during this period, and travelling extensively after his release, including to Finland for his first meeting with Lenin.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He was also, by his own later claim, organising peasant revolts elsewhere. None of these discrepancies are allowed to trouble the telling of a good tale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/26/dbd4f07b-e1ca-4fac-a961-65cd53ba04ac_2a48f19f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eventually the revolutionaries’ location was given away, although the hidden printers, tipped off, fled before the tsarist police arrived. These officers, despite numbering 150, were initially unable to discover the hidden press, but in the end they removed it and blew up the house.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was reconstructed in 1937, and perhaps the story of Stalin’s heroic involvement was assembled at the same time. But whatever the truth, the trip down a rusty spiral staircase in a dank shaft is still redolent of danger and derring-do.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An ancient attendant, staunchly Stalinist to this day, invites visitors to bend down and enter the horizontal passage to get a view of the original well down which the conspiracists descended. And to the squeals of complaining metal he demonstrates the operation of the even more ancient hand-cranked printing press, also now reconstructed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At ground level, forlorn rooms contain a reproduction of Stalin’s living quarters, and displays include a copy of a letter from Lenin to Stalin, handwritten notes by Stalin himself, and a copy of the first issue of Soviet Communism’s official organ, Pravda (“Truth”), although this was published in Moscow, and Stalin didn’t join the editorial board until 1917.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whatever the truth of the museum’s narrative, staff claim that the story remains part of the Chinese school syllabus, and the visitors’ book is certainly scattered with Chinese names and their comments in both Chinese and English: “Long live communist [sic],” says one. “Long live China-Georgia friendship.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/26/40b2b52e-c78b-4ddb-b1ee-b0478535bdf8_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the Stalin State Museum in Gori, there’s greater grandeur. The battered cottage that was the childhood home of shoemaker’s son Stalin until 1883, and home to his memorial museum from 1937, is now dwarfed by the neoclassical temple built over it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Behind is an elegant mansion, erected after Stalin’s death, in 1957, to house a more extensive account of the dictator’s life.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Inside there’s a real whiff of the Soviet era in the red carpet running up a broad marble staircase beneath a substantial chandelier, leading directly to a bust of Stalin, and then to a series of large, high-ceilinged salons that present a purportedly forensic but, in fact, unscientific­ally selective account of the man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/26/682f452d-4b03-4fbb-bafc-e29d190d71ed_ed655021.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The museum’s exhibits run to about 47,000 items and displays begin with a watercolour of Stalin as a child, information about his teachers and his 1894 application letter to the rector of Tiflis (Tbilisi) Orthodox Seminary.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They continue with busts, portraits, copies of decrees, texts of speeches and historic photographs. Then accounts of military campaigns both domestic and foreign, displays of possessions including an ashtray and a musquash coat, and birthday gifts from foreign powers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Holodomor, the man-made famine of 1932-33 in which more than 3 million Ukrainians perished, is not mentioned; nor is the Great Terror (1936-38), in which Stalin’s critics were eliminated, with perhaps 750,000 murdered and a million exiled to Siberia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The only grudgingly dissonant notes in this symphony of sycophancy are a photograph of the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, an agreement between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany to divide up Central and Eastern Europe ahead of World War II, and a small selection of portraits of Georgian artists and intellectuals whom Stalin had persecuted or had murdered.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The name Stalin is derived from the Russian for “steel”, and the man appears to have shown his homeland no special softness. The number of his victims here was disproportionately large compared to the size of its population.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/26/1141b685-37e3-4d46-8d5e-307d1cafb087_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The museum has been mostly frozen in time since 1979,” says one staff member, except, he points out, for one recently added display tucked away beneath the grand main staircase. This most independent visitors overlook, and tour guides ignore altogether.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even here – among photographs of railway construction and firing squads – criticism is expressed more in generalities, and mentioned alongside the Soviet Union’s rapid industrialisation under Stalin. There’s rather more space given to the atrocities of recent Russian invasions of Georgia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But back out in more cheerful sunlight there’s charm in wandering along the corridor of Stalin’s personal railway carriage, and more charm still three hours to the west, in Tskaltubo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/26/8cf81998-3615-475a-9a90-78b51089fbce_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At its peak, the spa town was served by four trains a day from Moscow, a journey that took two days. It grew to support a number of sanatoriums in both traditional and Sputnik-era modernist styles, as well as comfortable hotels for the apparatchiks and more modest accommodation for the proletariat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Business collapsed with the end of the Soviet Union and Georgian independence in April 1991, although some of Tskaltubo’s abandoned buildings were reopened to house refugees from the 1992 Russian occupation of Abkhazia, in Georgia’s northwest. Some refugees are still resident today.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But now private enterprise has been invited in, there’s some revival of business, and various buildings are shrouded in scaffolding, while others, such as Sanatorium No 6, have already been renovated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/26/5eb0f0bc-8b33-4294-967b-7252842ce3b0_117276d7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A frieze on the portico, in high relief, shows Stalin accepting flowers from a peasant woman holding a child, with other happy workers and peasants behind.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Here the big man bathed, but there are no signs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Go round to the right,” says a receptionist. “The nurse will show you.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Across a columned entrance hall of a certain wedding-cake grandeur, along a chair-lined passage and through a door, the building’s shiny smartness is suddenly replaced by decay, as if the refurbishment abruptly ran out of budget.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Substantial dust-covered leather armchairs sag in an anteroom, through which steps lead down into a large sunken bath, brightly lit by high arched windows and floored with a mosaic of sea creatures that seem more appropriate to a children’s paddling pool than to the downtime of a dictator.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/26/c1830440-47d7-4742-8d4f-88c45969d8b9_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As with all Stalin-related narratives the truth isn’t clear, but it is thought that he perhaps wallowed here in 1931 and again in 1951. Now unheralded and unloved, tiles beginning to drop from the walls, the bath may eventually be restored to its former glory, or may be refitted for other purposes. The staff are unable to say.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sidelined as Stalin may be here, he is doing better than at Batumi, now a major resort town, two hours southwest on the Black Sea coast, but also once a base for his youthful campaigning activities. Here maps cannot even accurately place his old flat, despite the fact it is, according to numerous sources, preserved as a shrine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When finally found among older hou­sing and new construction, there’s no entry, public access having been “abolished” in 2013, according to Georgian television, for lack of interest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOramarpWhfKK%2B06KapZ1faH90hZFxZ2irpJa5qrrSZp2op6Sowaa80maenqeinLaiecyuqp6tnah6ta7IpaCsoV2Wu6V5x6KqZpqZp8GpvMuamp5ll6G8s7XFsmSdoZOprrW70WafoqtdpbKzv86nmKVlkpbBqQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kardashians-oj-simpson-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kris, Khloe, Kim, Caitlyn, Kendall</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-care-for-your-clothing-101-tips.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to Care for Everything in Your Closet: 101 Tips</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
