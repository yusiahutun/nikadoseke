Has She Married?&nbsp;</h2><p>Olivia Bastianich rose to fame as the eldest child of an accomplished businessman and restaurateur, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Joe Bastianich</strong></a>. Her father's success is known throughout the country, and it's no surprise that she became a center of interest to both the media and the public.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/08/31/olivia-bastianich-1598869448.jpg width=450 height=337 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Olivia Bastianich posing with her great-grandmother Erminia Motika. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Facebook</span></strong><p>Olivia has never appeared on TV with her celebrity dad, which shows she refrains from being in the limelight.

We wish her the best!</p><p>Speaking about her relationship status, it is in the dark. The celebrity kid lives a low-key lifestyle and does not want to live an ostentatious life. It's tough to say for sure whether she is dating anyone or single. Her low activity on social media has contributed to the scarcity of information about her relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>But this is for certain, the celebrity daughter is not married so far does not have a husband, and is focusing on her career. But as far as her relationship goes, it is a mystery.</p><p>Joe's daughter is also not very active on social media. The young lady has an Instagram account but has set it to private. Also, she rarely appears on her father's Instagram account.&nbsp;</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/08/31/olivia-bastianich-1598869506.jpg width=450 height=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Olivia Bastianich posing alongside her grandmother at her high school graduation ceremony in 2016.&nbsp;</span><span class=imageSource> SOURCE: Facebook</span></strong><p>Talking about her family members, her mother, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Deanna Bastianich</a>, </strong>is also a business manager and manages businesses with her dad.

At present, Joe's daughter has been working as an associate at SG Partners where she joined in March 2023.&nbsp; She is just at the beginning stage of her career, so she does not have a net worth yet.</p><p>Regardless, she still lives an opulent lifestyle thanks to her wealthy dad.
