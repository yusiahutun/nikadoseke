However, a few stand out from the rest. These are the greatest black female rock singers of all time.</p><h3>1. Brittany Howard</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a95bd78c54b7a3ca.jpg><p class=align-left>Before Brittany Howard became one of the greatest black women in rock, she used to be a commercial sanitation worker and even worked as a mail delivery woman. But while working in different environments, she played covers and original songs with the blues-rock band, <i>Alabama Shakes</i>.</p><h3>2. Donna Summer</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/295e9e37115a8f9f.jpg><p class=align-left>In the late 1960s, Donna Summer, one of the greatest black female rock stars of all time, joined the blues-rock band called <i>Crow</i>. Although it dissolved, she went on to release her debut studio album titled <i>Lady of the Night</i> in 1974. The songs in the album consisted of the pop/rock/folk variety.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cd5113b69aeef6bb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 greatest black comedians from the 70s who were so funny</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 1978, she became the first female artist in the modern rock era to have the number one single on the Hot 100. For her contributions in rock, she won a Grammy Award in the Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. In 2013, she became an inductee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><h3>3. Etta James</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0f6353c163d24ccb.jpg><p class=align-left>Etta James had a powerful, deep, and earthy voice that made it easy for her to sing songs in the rock and roll genre. She first ventured into rock genre in 1973 and released a self-titled album that got a Grammy Award nomination. However, she kept changing her musical style throughout her career.</p><p class=align-left>As a result, many overlooked her contributions to music. But when she started to bridge the gap between <a href=#>rhythm and blues</a> and rock and roll, she won many awards and became one of the greatest black rock n roll singers of all time. Etta James is an inductee of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e4dd3473ccf9fa95.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 25 female singers under 25 to watch out for in 2021</span></p></a><h3>4.

For many years, she embarked on singing a variety of musical styles, including R&B, disco, new wave, art pop, and <a href=#>reggae</a>. Her unique style has made it challenging for many people to follow in her footsteps.</p><p class=align-left>But despite her versatility in many music genres, she was brilliant whenever she sang a rock song. Grace Jones created groundbreaking rock music back in the 1980s. In 1999, VHI ranked her at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">number 82</a> in the list of <i>100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll</i>.</p><h3>5. Joan Armatrading</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5d21a669659cb836.jpg><p class=align-left>Joan Armatrading released her debut album in 1972, which blended jazz and folk. She had a style of music that drew an array of influences from other genres, including reggae, soul, blues, jazz, folk, and rock. Her career took her from 70s folk-pop to 80s rock.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c6039e12f14a667f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Diana King?

Nona Hendryx</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e4dd3473ccf9fa95.jpg><p class=align-left>Nona Hendryx launched a solo career in 1977 and released a self-titled album that blended soul and rock. Rock was not a popular genre among the black community when she was at the peak of her career. At that time, most black female artists were doing pop and disco songs.</p><p class=align-left>As a result, people described her as rebellious. Although her first album garnered favourable reviews, female rock soloists were not getting enough airplay. Being black made it even more challenging. Nona did what she loved and went on to become one of the greatest women in rock history.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/96f9b436fdbda49f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>5 power women who went through painful breakups, rose from the ashes</span></p></a><h3>7. Poly Styrene</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/347c18b1a1610402.jpg><p class=align-left>Poly Styrene was a British musician, singer, and songwriter. Throughout her career, people identified her as the frontwoman for the punk rock band X-Ray-Spex. It was one of the few rock bands with female singers formed in 1976. Poly Styrene had a stirring voice and eclectic songwriting skills that enabled her to shine in a white male-dominated genre of punk rock.</p><h3>8. Skin (Deborah Anne Dwyer)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3199e364fd677266.jpg><p class=align-left>Deborah Anne Dyer, known by the stage name Skin, is a songwriter, electronic music DJ, and singer. She is the lead vocalist of the rock band Skunk Anansie, once considered to be one of the most successful UK chart acts of between 1952 and 2003. Skin has played an instrumental role in popularising the group due to her powerful, wide-ranging soprano voice.</p><h3>9. Tina Turner</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c6039e12f14a667f.jpg><p class=align-left>Tina Turner has had a successful music career that spanned over 60 years. In that period, fans described her as the Queen of Rock and Roll. She sang with swagger, sensuality, and unstoppable energy. Like many other black women in music, she crossed racial obstacles and overcame fierce oppression to inspire rock as a music genre for everyone.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2f17cc342e2008f6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 25 beautiful black actresses over 50 you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tina Turner was a giant in the industry. She won over 160 awards, received over 180 nominations, and inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

Tracy Chapman</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fc8eb6b286558a23.jpg><p class=align-left>When Tracy Chapman released her debut album in 1988, politics dominated the scene and everything revolved around politicians. At that time, a young black woman with an acoustic guitar singing rock music would have seemed irrelevant. But that was not the case with Tracy Chapman.</p><p class=align-left>She shifted the balance of musical power, and when she released her debut single, <i>Fast Car</i>, in 1988, the male fraternity that dominated the rock music genre quickly noticed her as a worthy competitor. Chapman rose to fame swiftly and deadly. For her efforts, she won four Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Song and two Best Female Rock Vocal Performance awards.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a630417da89784d2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 15 black female gospel singers of all time</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The greatest black female rock singers have helped to overturn the idea that rock is a form of male rebellion and took their artistic freedom to create influential music.
