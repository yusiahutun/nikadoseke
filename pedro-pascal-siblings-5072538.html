He began getting his big break in 2019 as the title star of the Disney+ series&nbsp;The Mandalorian,&nbsp;and he’s made appearances elsewhere in the&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;universe, including in the show&nbsp;The Book of Boba Fett.&nbsp;Pedro, 48, became even more famous as the leading man of the zombie dystopia series&nbsp;The Last Of Us&nbsp;on HBO.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Besides being a critically-acclaimed actor, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pedro</a> is also a loving brother to two sisters and a younger brother. Born in Chile, the actor and his older sister&nbsp;<strong>Javiera&nbsp;</strong>fled the country with their parents, who supported socialist leader&nbsp;<strong>Salvador Allende,&nbsp;</strong>when dictator <strong>Augosto Pinochet&nbsp;</strong>took power. His parents took their family to the United States, where they had another son and daughter. The family eventually settled in Orange County, California.

Like her younger brother, she also pursued a career in entertainment, but most of her work is done off-screen. She serves as the Head of Local Originals For Spanish-Speaking Countries in Latin America for Amazon Studios, according to&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>.&nbsp;One of her biggest projects yet has been working on the Amazon Original&nbsp;Argentina, 1985.&nbsp;The 2022 film was nominated for Best International Feature Film at the 2023 Academy Awards. “It’s exciting to be part of such an ambitious project that will take audiences on a journey through a pivotal point in Argentina’s history,” Javiera told Variety,&nbsp;when the movie was announced.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>When the film was nominated, Javiera attended the Oscars, which her brother also attended and presented the Best Animated Film and Best Documentary Short awards. The brother and sister duo attended the event together, and Pedro shared a sweet photo of the two of them at the ceremony on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “Big sis energy,” he captioned the post.</p><h2>Nicolas Balmaceda Pascal</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Of all Pedro’s siblings, his younger brother&nbsp;<strong>Nicolas&nbsp;</strong>is the most private. When celebrating his younger brother’s birthday in 2019,&nbsp;The Last of Us&nbsp;actor penned a sweet message to him and revealed that his brother is a doctor, working towards a degree in neurology. “He’s getting his PHD in pediatric neurology. He hates attention and he loves doing good,” Pedro wrote in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> caption. “To punish him for being younger, smarter and more handsome I thought I would announce this to the world.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>On Nicolas’ <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, he has shown that he has an interest in astronomy. He often posts photos of the moon and other planets on the account. He also occasionally shares looks at his dog and celebrates his siblings’ accomplishments, like when his younger sister&nbsp;<strong>Lux&nbsp;</strong>was on a<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> magazine cover.&nbsp;</a></p><h2>Lux Pascal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Pedro-Pascal-Siblings-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Pedro’s youngest sibling <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lux</a>, 30, was born in 1992. Lux announced that she is transgender in a February 2021 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ya</a>&nbsp;magazine. When she came out, she revealed that her family were incredibly supportive of her. “For everyone in my family my transition has been very natural. Almost something they hoped would happen,” she told&nbsp;Ya.&nbsp;She has used her platform to support trans rights.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Like her brother, Lux is also an actress. Many of her projects have been in Spanish, but she did appear in the U.S. Netflix series&nbsp;Narcos,&nbsp;per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.&nbsp;She’s currently finishing up an MFA program at the prestigious Julliard School, and she’s shared some <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>updates</a> from school on her Instagram.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8%2Bem6unXaWutK%2FApWSsoZKhtq%2Bz0mZsaW9iaoB5ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bruce-willis-to-retire-from-acting-following-aphasia-diagnosis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bruce Willis to retire from acting due to aphasia diagnosis | Bruce Willis</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./15-mind-blowing-facts-about-howard-deutch.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Mind-blowing Facts About Howard Deutch</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
