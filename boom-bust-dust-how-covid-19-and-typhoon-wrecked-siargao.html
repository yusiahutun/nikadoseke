The couple married and decided to make a go of it in paradise. While James managed eco-retreat Greenhouse and the Kudo Surf Shop, Marja founded SEA Movement, a community-based NGO dedicated to protecting the local marine environment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In 2019 tourism was just booming,” says James O’Donnell. The island was surfing a wave of popularity, after a 2017 movie, romantic comedy Siargao, helped cement its reputation as the “Bali of The Philippines”.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">We need people to come and surf, to give jobs to localsJames O’Donnell, resort and surf shop owner on Siargao</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But as the pandemic washed onto Philippine shores in 2020, boom turned to bust for a lot of newly opened hotels, restaurants and bars.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Business owners really had to tighten down the screws and trim the fat to be sustainable through the pandemic,” says Filipino-American Eddie Nassr, whose family opened the Kaimana Resort Siargao in 2018. “Some didn’t have the resources.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">O’Donnell estimates that “over half the businesses that popped up before the pandemic have closed down”. Because of travel restrictions imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19 “we’ve been cut off from the world, the rest of the Philippines even”, he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/21/ef6b6214-0ca4-4144-ba6b-8827642fc6b5_5c60d7de.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Respite came in the third quarter of 2021, when the government eased domestic travel restrictions and hoteliers looked optimistically to the Christmas holiday, their mood buoyed by Siargao being chosen as Asia’s best island by the readers of Condé Nast Traveller. Then came Typhoon Rai, known locally as Odette.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The local government evacuated certain areas,” Nassr says. “A lot of people didn’t take it too seriously, but went reluctantly. In retrospect we can see that really saved a lot of lives.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">O’Donnell says: “They were forecasting a Category 2 or 3 storm. I’ve been through that before. But environmental factors started to align about 15 hours before it hit. We didn’t have good internet, it cut out and then when it came back on for 30 minutes or so I saw people writing, ‘Category 5, evacuate!’”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Philippines’ super typhoons highlight the deadly cost of climate change</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was too late and the O’Donnells, like the Nassr family, hunkered down on December 16 in their respective guest houses with staff and friends while the storm made short work of the tear-drop-shaped island and surrounding region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The pressure built up was like a jet engine ringing in your ears. It was so intense that it actually burst some windows,” recalls O’Donnell. The Greenhouse and Kaimana resorts were among the few buildings left standing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The most consistent story was that people ended up in the bathrooms, which was the most concrete portion of the house, as their home was getting torn apart,” Nassr says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/21/ead9d317-1592-4b76-b56e-b6c08f8e61bf_7aabb417.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One hillside village on the island of Bucas Grande, to the south of Siargao, was particularly hard hit, says O’Donnell. “All the houses were destroyed and the parents were lying over the children just to try to give them some protection.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A storm surge whipped up by the typhoon brought more damage. “In Burgos [at the northern tip of Siargao] there’s a sea wall that goes around the whole town, but the tide broke it into pieces, turning it into boulders that just mowed down houses,” says O’Donnell.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A lack of clean drinking water and shelter became acute problems in the aftermath of the storm. “For the first two weeks it was all about water,” says Gregory Guy, a Chinese-Filipino surfer from Manila who spends much of his time on the island and who took refuge in the Kaimana Resort when Rai struck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/21/d6ce3245-8d00-4998-b119-e286cd2fd6d0_5c60d7de.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The storm brought salt water onto the island and you couldn’t drink from the wells. Septic tanks all overflowed. It was really hot, people who drank the water started getting diarrhoea.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having been protected by mangroves, the O’Donnells’ boat was spared and James was able to venture out with the coastguard – whose own vessel had been destroyed – to see whether relief efforts were under way.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“At first we went to seek help in Surigao City. When we arrived there was a dead floating carabao (Philippine water buffalo) and debris everywhere,” says O’Donnell. “We soon realised Surigao City was also devastated.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Cantilan, though, they found supplies had been prepared for them to take back. “They knew Siargao got hit,” says Guy. “No calls could be made but they assumed someone would come with a boat and prepared supplies.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Islanders call Cantilan “the mainland”, says Marja O’Donnell, “as it is the nearest point on the main island of Mindanao. [It] was where James and a crew of local boatmen, coastguard and fellow business owners headed to get supplies like petrol, solar lights, generators, food and water. Much was supplied by the Cantilan Bank team.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With looting rife, the O’Donnells’ guest house became an emergency distribution centre.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">The last time Siargao was hit by a big storm was in the 1980s … if this starts happening every five years, well, people just won’t be able to survive.Marja O’Donnell, NGO founder</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Greenhouse is situated on the main tourism road and is very accessible,” says Marja O’Donnell. “It is also beachfront and has access to a dock for our speedboat and other hired boats. It became a point of emergency distribution because of its location and ease of logistics.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile Nassr, an engineer by trade, spearheaded water collection and distribution efforts. “They located abandoned resorts with generators and used them to power up water facilities with the assistance of the police,” says Guy. “They also got the owner of the ice plant to help supply drinking water to the people.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The whole community came together, says Marja O’Donnell. But, more than a month on, the situation remains critical.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/21/c9957f74-c7ae-4f05-adad-314be0f78613_dd24bf42.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Ninety per cent of the island is devastated,” she says. The whole of Surigao del Norte has officially been declared a state of calamity in view of the “the damage caused by tropical storm Odette”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To help the relief effort, Marja O’Donnell has repurposed her NGO. “I can use the social media pages to reach out and raise funds. We can also help in a logistical capacity as we have a boat and a car,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In the short term we need basic supplies like water, food, medicine and shelter, as a lot of people are homeless or have severely damaged houses. But it’s hard because it’s monsoon season and the internet has been down on the island.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">More than 2 in 5 people tested for Covid-19 in the Philippines have it</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Those staying in resorts that have a generator are the fortunate ones, says Guy. “But maybe 40 per cent of all the electrical posts have been damaged by falling trees. Four companies are working around the clock to fix that and they say power might be back [soon] in certain tourist areas, but that still leaves most of the island in the dark.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The resurgence of Covid-19 is exacerbating the situation. In 2021, the Philippines fell to last place in Bloomberg’s Covid Resilience Ranking and is averaging over 33,000 new cases a day as of January 20.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is not hard to imagine how fast an outbreak on Siargao would spread under current conditions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/21/77da633e-0ab8-4076-b82c-8c31ad8eea56_595de0ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nassr estimates that it will be three to four months before Siargao will be ready to start hosting visitors in significant numbers again, and James O’Donnell – who likens the economic damage of the typhoon to “Covid on steroids” for an island that runs on tourism – believes they cannot return soon enough.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We need people to come and surf, to give jobs to locals,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Philippines contributes less than 0.4 per cent of global carbon emissions but is especially vulnerable to rising tides and extreme weather events driven by the warming planet.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With waters rising and storms worsening, President Rodrigo Duterte has suggested that rebuilding efforts should not be undertaken near the coast. Marja O’Donnell doesn’t disagree, but she sees regional poverty as an issue that must be taken into account.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/21/3576b3a1-a54a-44c8-a7bd-e40753e3c3c2_595de0ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People who live below the poverty line are so vulnerable. If we move them inland we must consider how they are going to sustain themselves as they live from fishing and the sea.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She sees Typhoon Rai as one more weather shock that should prod the world’s governments into climate action.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The storm hit luxury resorts just as hard as it hit fishing villages. The last time Siargao was hit by a big storm was in the 1980s. They say it happens every 20 years or so. But if this starts happening every five years, well, people just won’t be able to survive.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kmptbWpkaXyju86mZJuto6l6pcHSrWShp6disLDCyJ1kanFdlruledOyp6Gnn6N6uL7EnKKenF2otqK%2Bxpqm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./katy-perry-causes-stir-unexpected-bikini-exciting-news-just-eat.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Katy Perry causes a stir in edgy bikini in new video you need to see</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./erinclichemag-com.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Celebrity Matchmaker Alessandra Conti Considers Herself a Crocheter of Love</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
