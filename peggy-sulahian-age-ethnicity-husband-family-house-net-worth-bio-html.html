The two tied the knot back in 1995 in Beverly Hills and have been adding a different meaning to their love ever since then.</p><p>But while she claims she has a perfect marriage, there were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reports </a>that Peggy and Diko got divorced a year after their marriage. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=607 style="margin-top:15px!important;margin-right:auto!important;line-height:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important;float:none!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;text-align:center!important;min-height:400px;max-width:580px;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;padding:0;margin-left:auto!important;display:block!important;min-width:580px;width:580px"></span></p><p>Diko reportedly filed the divorce on April 24, 1996, and they&nbsp;separated on March 29, 1996. The divorce was said to be finalized by Judge Robert A. Schinder&nbsp;on December 11, 1996.</p><p>Shockingly,&nbsp;neither party was said to be present when the divorce got officially finalized. But in contrary to reports, the two are still together and are madly in love with one another, which is made even sweeter by the presence of their three kids, daughters, Giovanna and&nbsp;Gianelle&nbsp;and their son, Koko. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=608 style="margin-right:auto!important;min-width:250px;min-height:400px;max-width:580px;padding:0;margin-top:15px!important;line-height:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;display:block!important;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;float:none!important;margin-left:auto!important;text-align:center!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px"></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>When the media asked their reps if the reports of their divorce and separation were true, no statements were released, which is why it remains unclear if the reports hold any truth!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, when Peggy knew about these reports, she lashed back and ranted as,</p><p>“As you can see, I have an amazing relationship with my husband Diko,”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>&nbsp;“We have the best of times being silly, with love and laughter, even having fun with a topic of idioms such as ‘beating a dead horse,'”&nbsp;</p><p>She then added, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=609 style="min-height:400px;float:none!important;min-width:250px;line-height:0;padding:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px;margin-bottom:15px!important;max-width:580px;display:block!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-right:auto!important;text-align:center!important"></span></p><p>“I googled it later, to find out it meant something pointless to discuss since it’s been discussed so many times already; he’s so right.”</p><p>And that is what seems to be the reality indeed, as no crack can be spotted in their relationship.</p><h2>The Family Background of Peggy Sulahian In A Short Wiki-Like Bio:</h2><p>Peggy Sulahian was born in &nbsp;Kuwait on&nbsp;July&nbsp;30,&nbsp;1973.

It’s when I have the most fun, and express my fun personality the best. A close friend of ours is huge on pulling pranks in public. The “butterfly prank” is one of his classics when we’re at restaurants. As seen in the episode, I persuaded Diko into doing the prank, and we started to laugh hysterically. Life is short! We need to enjoy it! After all, that’s the secret to a long-lasting marriage: having fun. When I’m with Diko, it’s when I get to express who I really am. The only reason the girls think I have a resting bitch face is because my guard is up all the time. I’m always in defensive mode with them, but all it takes is a little warming up to me.</p><p>Her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">confrontation with Tamara Judge</a> in the show was an interesting one as well! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Oh, things are exciting on the show, so you make sure you tune into the show and not miss out on a single episode!</p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Stay with us</a> for the emerging updates on Peggy Sulahian and RHOC!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqmdl5zGbr%2FUpZihoZGjeqKzxGacraCenrCqwNhmn66rkpa7pXnFmqSipKlitbDB0p5kp52kYsSwvtOhZJuhn2O1tbnL</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./victoria-paige-meyerink.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Victoria Paige Meyerink</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./miranda-lambert-lainey-wilson-epic-instagram-comment.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Miranda Lambert Stand Up for Lainey Wilson with Epic Comment</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
