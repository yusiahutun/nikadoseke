Understanding her background would likely provide more insight into the unfortunate event.</p><p class=align-left>Bernadette Protti is an American of Italian descent, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born on September 20, 1968</a>. She attended Miramonte High School, along with Kirsten and other children from her locality.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7218c017dc03a45d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Skylar Neese: The tragic story of the teen murdered by her friends</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Bernadette, the youngest of six children, grew up in a hard-working <a href=#>family</a>, but she was not happy and content with how things were. Bernadette’s parents were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">devout Christians</a> (Catholics). Her father was a retired public works officer, and her mother a homemaker. Therefore, it was hard for the Protti’s to afford the lifestyle that Bernadette desired.</p><p class=align-left>She considered her parents too old and also felt that they were not listening to her. On top of this, her <a href=#>house</a> was a bit dilapidated. The paint was peeling off, and it put a lot of pressure on her sensitive self-esteem as she never imagined living in such a place.</p><p class=align-left>Aside from her family conditions, Bernadette Protti had other underlying problems. For example, she had issues with her body and considered herself unattractive and undesirable. And, of course, at her age, the perception made her quite bitter.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/12aa27019e1c27f6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Felicia Forbes: The story of Tommy 'Tiny' Lister's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Bernadette admired and idolized Kirsten, her schoolmate. She wanted to be like her, and she struggled a lot to make it happen. It was okay at her age, like most teenagers who wish for the ultimate pinnacle of popularity. Her biggest desire was to be liked and succeed, just like Kirsten.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, she faced numerous obstacles at becoming as cool as her idol. First, she never made it to the cheerleading team and did not make it to the yearbook staff.</p><p class=align-left>However, she got a job in the student office alongside Kirsten, which resulted in the popular girl asking Bernadette to do her different favours. Of course, these favours were quite risky as they would have resulted in the termination of Kirsten's privileges. So Bernadette helped her out to gain acceptance.</p><p class=align-left>Bernadette joined the Bobbies, a volunteer group created to organize fundraisers and other charitable events. However, despite being a member of this popular entity, she wasn’t satisfied as she wanted more.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/056aed0e13bc2a47.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Maria Aquinar: What you should know about Sebastian Bach's ex-wife</span></p></a><h2>What happened to Kirsten Costas?</h2><p class=align-left>As you have likely seen from Bernadette Protti's documentary, Kirsten Costas was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">murdered with a butcher knife</a> out of jealousy by Bernadette Protti. But how did it come to this? First, an assumedly innocent girl murdering her schoolmate got people by surprise. You will be startled by how the events unfolded on that fateful day.</p><p class=align-left>It all started with Bernadette inviting Kirsten to a party, which the latter was unaware of. Bernadette had devised an ingenious plan to win over Kirsten. She called Kirsten's home while she was away and told her mother that her daughter was invited to a Bobbies' dinner, and it was a secret.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Bernadette informed her parents that she had a babysitting job that day. She picked up Kirsten for dinner as promised, using her parent's car. Although Kirsten was surprised to find out that it wasn't one of her friends as expected, she obliged and got into the car.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1f77107a3d2287d3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lisa Thorner: 5 interesting facts about Damon Wayans' ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Also, she noticed a knife in the car, but Bernadette brushed it off by stating that her sister keeps it there to cut vegetables and fruits. However, things got weird when Kirsten realized that Bernadette's invitation was of a second-hand nature, and she wouldn't want to go to a party where she wasn't invited first-hand.</p><p class=align-left>Kirsten left the<a href=#> car</a> and went to the home of Alexander and Mary Jane to call her parents. She told them that she was with a friend and she had gotten weird on her. Unfortunately, no one was home as nobody answered the call. Seeing this, Alex offered to drive Kirsten home.</p><p class=align-left>Bernadette watched as they left and followed them, parking outside Kirsten's home. Bernadette was worried about her reputation since she had embarrassed herself, and she couldn't allow things to come out.</p><p class=align-left>As Kirsten headed towards her house from Alex's car, she spotted Bernadette on the street and headed towards her. Bernadette grabbed the knife from the vehicle and met Kirsten on her neighbour's lawn, and a scuffle ensued.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/63a99ed75b32af00.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bryan Callen: divorce story, wife, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>At the end of the struggle, Kirsten was stabbed twice in the stomach and twice in the back. She was rushed to the hospital by ambulance as police secured the scene. Unfortunately, she was pronounced dead on Saturday, June 23, 1984, as one of the stab wounds had bisected the heart's major artery.</p><h2>What did investigators find out?</h2><p class=align-left>It took investigators some time to conclude the case, which is quite baffling when looking back at the circumstances leading to the murder.</p><p class=align-left>Bernadette took a lie detector test as they questioned students, whose results were inconclusive, proving neither guilt nor innocence. However, Bernadette's babysitting alibi went unverified.</p><p class=align-left>In the beginning, the investigators had suspected Nancy Kane, a girl that happened to be bullied by Kirsten a lot. As a result, many students believed that she was responsible for killing Kirsten. The rumours were so intense that her mother prevented her from taking a lie detector test and transferred her from the learning institution.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7c8f0f39d42f9399.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Melissa Womer: children, Jim Carrey, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Bernadette later wrote a letter to her parents confessing to the murder. According to the letter, she was able to live with it but couldn't ignore it. After her mother read it, she picked her up from school and went to the police station to record the confession.</p><h2>Bernadette’s conviction</h2><p class=align-left>Bernadette was sentenced to nine years (maximum) for second-degree murder on April 1, 1985. The prosecution failed to prove that Bernadette had premeditated Kirsten's homicide.</p><h2>What did Bernadette Protti change her name to?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ffeb64753765ffa7.jpg><p class=align-left>After her sentencing, Bernadette was sent to California Youth Authority in Ventura, where she completed <a href=#>high school </a>and received her GED.
