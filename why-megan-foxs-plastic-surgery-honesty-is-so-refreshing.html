Fashion's Junior Beauty Writer</figure><p id=em7gpDXXgB8 data-wc=51>Megan begins by explaining that she knows all too well how insanely infatuated the world is with her appearance “I'm just gonna go through all the things that I've done because I feel like there's this stigma and I'm not going to win. However, I'm hoping it sets some people free."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/a822485acbc8-meganfox169946443332316643527294018301376331573.jpg><p id=enKQUGZfvqv data-wc=148>Over the years Megan has been well aware of the fact that her appearance has been the talking point of many conversations around the world, which is why her honesty about her plastic surgery work is such a breath of fresh air. s Junior Beauty Writer<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Lydia Mormen&nbsp;</a>is constantly exposed to the world of cosmetic augmentation in her line of work as a beauty mogul and says "It’s really refreshing to see celebrities opening up about the procedures they’ve had and not being ashamed to talk about them. It can be so damaging, for women of all ages but especially for young girls, to aspire to a certain look that’s actually been achieved with a little extra help. Hopefully, it’s something we will see more people in the public eye begin to open up about as cosmetic procedures continue to become more advanced and seemingly undetectable."</p><figure class="HFMQuote_hd2j4x3 quoteClass_qcs0mq1 -category-beauty-trends -style-3"><p id=eFaVUsuSxwP8>"She's always faced scrutiny for her looks and if procedures and surgery make her happy, then why shouldn't she?"</p>Emma North, Hello! Fashion's Deputy Beauty Editor</figure><p id=e6ALsA_q6Xu data-wc=80>As for the procedures she has had done, Megan reveals that she got a boob job when she was “21 or 22” and then had them redone once she was “done breastfeeding” and then again most recently (which is the set she has now) explaining that she “didn't have enough body fat to disguise, you could see the rippling of the implant, so I had to switch them out to this set. They're not even that big. They’re a 32D."</p><p id=eNvM0Ke35vS data-wc=69>As for her face card, Meg admitted to having a nose job in her early twenties, despite what onlookers may think, saying "I had my nose done when I was in my early 20s. I've literally been accused of having six, seven, or eight rhinoplasty surgeries, which is impossible, your nose would get necrosis and fall off. I haven't had a rhinoplasty since I was, I'm gonna say, 23."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/ace77197c9a4-gettyimages-601995614.jpg><p id=elUjROLV3p data-wc=91>Megan is the latest celeb to come forward about cosmetic procedures, joining the likes of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Ariana Grande</a> who admitted late last year to getting “a ton of lip filler and Botox over the years ”, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Khloe Kardashian</a> who revealed she has had a nose job, Ashley Tisdale who told fans she had her breast implants removed and <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Kylie Jenner</a> who after years of fan speculation admitted to getting lip fillers, telling her Sister Kim in an <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Allure interview</a> that she "definitely made (her) lips a little too big at one point."</p><p id=etf4lolRsw data-wc=118>s Deputy Beauty Editor<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Emma North&nbsp;</a>commends Megan's honesty, saying "I have respect for Hollywood stars admitting to having surgery in the first place. Megan's look has changed a lot since her early 20s and you can certainly tell she's dabbled with procedures like fillers and botox, but I say all power to her. If she wants them, why not? She's always faced scrutiny for her looks and if procedures and surgery make her happy, then why shouldn't she? Do I also think she's setting an unrealistic, possibly dangerous, beauty standard for women? Maybe, but it's important to remind yourself that she did have surgery and that her look isn't going to be achievable without it.

However, the star did conclude the episode with a cheeky “There's one thing I had done that I'm gatekeeping, sorry. It was really good, and it's not a known plastic surgery." Leaving fans right back where they started, wondering what on earth the mysterious procedure could be.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue8GemK6sqWLBs7HNnapobWFqhXmDjrCfsmWdmrSiuoyfprGrXaW5or%2FToppmq6WntKa%2B2GafqKaVqMG6ecisZKynXaeyp77ErJ%2Bippdk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./biggest-shark-tank-fails-132162.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Biggest Shark Tank Fails: See 6 Products That Didn't Make It After the Show</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-best-couples-to-follow-for-travel-lust.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Couples to Follow for Travel Lust</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
