The “Lonely” singer also paired the look with a faux fur cape and platform heels. Ben, 49, wore a simple black tuxedo and didn’t walk the red carpet with J-Lo. While they weren’t photographed together on the carpet, J-Lo and Ben were photographed together backstage sharing a romantic kiss with their masks on.

And now that Bennifer is back on, they aren’t shying away from attending events together. While J-Lo and Ben’s 2021 Met Gala arrival marked the first time the pair has attended Vogue’s star-studded annual event as a couple, it isn’t their first foray back into the red carpet scene.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/jennifer-lopez-met-gala-1.jpg><p>J-Lo and Ben’s <a href=#>Met Gala</a> appearance came just days after the couple walked their first red carpet in nearly 20 years together. The couple made their post-reunion red carpet debut at the 2021 Venice Film Festival on September 10 for the premiere of The Last Duel. (Ben plays 14th-century European count Pierre d’Alençon in the film, which is set to arrive in theaters in October in the United States.) Prior to this premiere, J-Lo and Ben’s last red carpet appearance together was in 2003 for Ben’s movie&nbsp;Daredevil.</p><p>The&nbsp;Hustlers&nbsp;star, 51, and&nbsp;Argo&nbsp;producer, 48, began dating for the first time after meeting on the set of&nbsp;Gigli&nbsp;in 2001.&nbsp;<a href=#>Bennifer</a>, as they soon became known, were engaged by November 2002 after Ben popped the question with a 6.1-carat pink diamond <a href=#>engagement ring</a> from Harry Winston. The pair were set to wed in September 2003, but just two days before their nuptials, J-Lo and Ben revealed their decision to “postpone” their wedding. “Due to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding, we have decided to postpone the date. When we found ourselves seriously contemplating hiring three separate ‘decoy brides’ at three different locations, we realized that something was awry,” the couple said in a statement at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/jennifer-lopez-met-gala-2-e1631583102465.jpg><p><br>Their statement continued, “We began to feel that the spirit of what should have been the happiest day of our lives could be compromised. We felt what should have been a joyful and sacred day could be spoiled for us, our families and our friends.” By early 2004, it became clear that a wedding was no longer on the table as the couple formally announced their decision to separate. “I am confirming the report that <a href=# id=auto-tag_jennifer-lopez data-tag=jennifer-lopez>Jennifer Lopez</a> has ended her engagement to Ben Affleck,” J-Lo’s rep said in a statement at the time. “At this difficult time, we ask that you respect her privacy.”</p><p>In her 2014 memoir, <a data-pmc-sp-product=3f92e9bc6d9d9b38a068cfdfa595df22 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"True Love","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"True Love","price":"28.83","id":"0451468686","category":"Portraits"},"id":1226914,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>True Love</a> , J-Lo revealed that her breakup with Ben was the “first real heartbreak” she ever experienced. “Ben and I split up at the moment when I thought we were committing to each other forever,” the Selena actress wrote.&nbsp;“It was my first real heartbreak, it felt like my heart had been torn out of my chest.” Years later, however, J-Lo’s heartbreak has clearly mended over thanks to her reunion with Ben following her split from her former <a href=# rel=noopener>fiancé, Alex Rodriguez</a>, in April.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/True-Love-Jennifer-Lopez.jpg><p>For more about J-Lo’s life, check out <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">True Love by Jennifer Lopez</a>. The 2014 memoir covers the “Jenny on the Block” singer’s career and personal life, from her start as a dancer to when she became a mom of two twins with her now-ex-husband Marc Anthony. In the book, which includes more than 200 personal photographs from J-Lo’s never-before-seen collection, the Selena actress writes about how “she confronted her greatest challenges, identified her biggest fears, and ultimately emerged a stronger person than she’s ever been” to become the pop icon we know today.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
