DIY enthusiasts everywhere take advantage of these tools. The lineup has much to offer, but if you're looking for something more compact, convenient, and affordable, you'll want to check out Ryobi's USB Lithium platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryobi launched its new line of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USB-C rechargeable tools</a> in early 2022 and is slowly but surely expanding into an excellent arsenal of tools for at-home jobs. These are smaller than your average drill or <a href=#>impact wrench</a>, like rotary cutters and ratchets, but have plenty of power and usage scenarios. Here's whether Ryobi's USB Lithium tools are worth buying.</p><p>Before we begin, it's important to note that the type of tool you buy will depend on the job, your profession, or personal preference. Similar to automotive enthusiasts, tool fanatics are a passionate bunch. I'm not here to tell you Ryobi is better than DeWALT, and these USB options aren't designed to compete with those brands. That said, this compact series has plenty to offer.</p><h2 id=who-makes-ryobi-tools>Who Makes Ryobi Tools?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ryobi-usb-lithium.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Ryobi brand was founded way back in 1943 and rose to prominence by making die-cast products in the 80s. Today, the brand makes printing equipment, power tools, lawnmowers, work wear, and other hardware.</p><p>A common question online is regarding the origin of its tools. In 2000, Techtronic Industries (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TTI Group</a>) acquired the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">licensing rights</a> to the Ryobi Tool name in North America, along with all its facilities and operations, and then partnered with The Home Depot. TTI is a large-scale manufacturer based in China that makes a wide array of well-known tools and home supplies. Some of those include Ryobi, Milwaukee Tool, Ridgid, along with <a href=#>HART power tools sold at Walmart</a>. Fun fact: TTI also makes Hoover and Dirt Devil vacuums. Ryobi still has divisions in the United States, such as in Indiana, but it's a die-cast manufacturer and doesn't produce tools.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, whether you use a Milwaukee on the job site, a bright neon green Ryobi, or a new USB Lithium, it likely came from TTI.</p><h2 id=all-powered-by-a-usb-c-rechargeable-battery>All Powered by a USB-C Rechargeable Battery</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ryobi-3ah-battery.jpg><p>The Ryobi USB Lithium platform runs on small 4V 2Ah or 3Ah battery packs that you can quickly recharge with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated charger</a> like any other tool, or you have the option to recharge via a USB-C cable like you use for smartphones. The <a href=#>one battery powers every tool</a> in the lineup, which currently offers 18 different options and is rapidly expanding. Sure, 4V isn't as powerful as your typical 18V tool, but it doesn't need to be when it runs smaller devices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you can see, each battery has a <a href=#>USB-C</a> charging port and an onboard LED charging indicator that Ryobi calls a "fuel gauge" that users can press to see the remaining level and status. Once fully charged, slide it into any USB Lithium tool like a typical (but bigger) AA battery, and you're ready to go. They're also highly affordable, running <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$19.97 at Home Depot</a>, so feel free to grab a few and swap them out between tools and charging as needed. The bigger <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">3Ah battery is $34.97</a> and offers 50% more runtime.</p><p>From my testing with a regular USB-C cable and a phone charger, the 3Ah battery takes around two hours to recharge, which isn't great. However, Ryobi sells a 3-port charging dock that's 80% quicker, which is probably your best bet. With it, you'll always have a little USB Lithium battery charged and ready to go. And with how cheap each battery is, there's no reason not to have at least 3-4 of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, these battery packs are completely redesigned and will not operate any of the over 200 Ryobi ONE+ power tools Home Depot already sells. This is a smaller platform for devices that require less juice.</p><h2 id=ryobi-usb-lithium-tool-lineup>Ryobi USB Lithium Tool Lineup</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ryobi-lithium.jpg><p>These 2/3Ah battery packs power compact little tools for jobs around the house. You won't find a full-size drill and driver combo, an impact wrench, large angle grinders, or jig saws. Instead, the USB Lithium series delivers capable tools to make everyday tasks easier. I'm talking about an electric screwdriver, portable fans, small LED work lights, and electric box cutters for all those Amazon packages you get weekly. Again, these aren't full-size "power tools" in the traditional sense, but they're still handy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Initially, Ryobi's USB Lithium series only had a few tools, but as of writing, the list includes 18 versatile options to fill your toolbox. Here's the full current lineup, and expect more shortly:</p><ul><li>Electric Screwdriver</li><li>Power Cutter</li><li>Clamp Fan</li><li>High Pressure Inflator</li><li>Rotary Tool (Dremel)</li><li>Compact LED Flashlight</li><li>LED Flip Light</li><li>LED Pivoting Laser Flashlight</li><li>LED Magnifying Light</li><li>LED Inspection Light</li><li>Power Scrubber</li><li>Power Carver</li><li>Cordless Glue Pen</li><li>Soldering Pen</li><li>Foam Cutter</li><li>1/4 Ratchet</li><li>3/8 Ratchet</li><li>Desktop Vacuum</li></ul><p>As you can see, this is a somewhat short list, with most of the choices revolving around lights, fans, and small household tools. Milwaukee has a similar line that's way more expensive, making this an excellent option for those on a budget. Plus, like every other collection from Ryobi, this list will expand in the coming months and years. Over time, I expect vastly more tools running on the same 2Ah USB battery packs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-ryobi-usb-lithium-tools-worth-buying>Are Ryobi USB Lithium Tools Worth Buying?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ryobi-usb-battery-phone.jpg><p>So, back to the original question. Is it worth buying some of Ryobi's latest USB Lithium tools? In my opinion, absolutely. I already own a wide assortment of Ryobi tools, more than I care to admit, and these are refreshingly lightweight, easy to use, and affordable. Plus, getting a spare battery for $20 is fantastic, especially considering how expensive the bigger packs are for full-size tools.</p><p>Being powered by a small battery pack with a USB-C port built-in makes these extremely easy to handle and recharge. You don't have to find a big battery charger and can use any <a href=#>USB-C cable</a>. More importantly, thanks to the included port, it'll double as a <a href=#>portable battery bank</a> for charging phones, tablets, headphones, and other gadgets in a pinch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Will one of these be the ideal option to jump under the hood of a truck or take to an electrician job site? No, probably not. However, that's not the target audience. These are convenient tools for arts and crafts, hobbies, and at-home DIY jobs for the average person. Sometimes, all you need is a few small tools, and if you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars for an entire power tool setup, this is a great middle ground.</p><p>Find Ryobi's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USB Lithium series at Home Depot</a>, and try one today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGiYq51dp8awrshmrKyaXaG2tbTIrqRmqJ%2BssrN506impatdrLyzwMdmma6xmaO0cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brooklyn-beckhams-ex-hana-cross-wows-skimpy-orange-bikini-poses-sizzling-snaps-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brooklyn Beckham's ex Hana Cross wows in a skimpy orange bikini as she poses for sizzling snaps</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrate-bob-barker-s-91st-birthday-by-checking-out-10-classic-game-show-hosts-then-and-now-46038.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'The Price is Right' Host Bob Barker Celebrates 91st Birthday</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
