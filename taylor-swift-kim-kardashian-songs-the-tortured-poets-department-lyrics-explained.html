I made that bitch famous.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Swift publicly denied approving the lines, Kardashian released an edited three-minute video recording of an alleged phone call between West and Swift, in which the singer appeared to consent to West using the controversial lyric. As Swifties will recall, the backlash against her was immediate and brutal, leading Swift to retreat from the public eye and later release her vengeful sixth studio album, Reputation. (When the full recording of the 25-minute call was leaked in 2020, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/taylor-swift-kanye-west-phone-call-leaks-read-full-transcript-1203541363/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="it did confirm" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">it did confirm</a> that West had not included the word bitch when sharing the lyrics with Swift.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In “thanK you aIMee,” the singer compares Kardashian to “a bronze spray-tanned statue” and a school bully who “threatens to push me down the stairs.” She also accuses the reality TV mogul of publicly ridiculing her in the aftermath of the 2016 scandal by “[writing] headlines” and “laughing at each baby step I’d take.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite the uphill battle, Swift notes that the adversity made her stronger: “I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool / I built a legacy which you can’t undo / But when I count the scars, there’s a moment of truth / That there wouldn't be this, if there hadn’t been you.” She also admits to hiding Kardashian’s real identity in a song: “And so I changed your name, and any real defining clues / And one day, your kid comes home singin’ / A song that only us two is gonna know is about you.”</p><img alt="2015 mtv video music awards backstage" title="2015 MTV Video Music Awards - Backstage" width=1997 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-and-kim-kardashian-west-attend-the-2015-mtv-news-photo-1713536510.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kevin Mazur/MTV1415</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A similar theme of betrayal and defamation plays out in “Cassandra,” with Swift describing her own exoneration “when the truth comes out.” The song’s namesake is most likely the Cassandra of ancient Greek mythology, who was blessed with the power to foresee disaster, but cursed to never have her prophecies believed. Swift compares herself to the Trojan priestess, singing, “They set my life in flames, I regret to say / Do you believe me now?” She also calls out the hypocrisy of a family that touts Christian values while simultaneously pursuing greed: “The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line / They all said nothing / Blood’s thick but nothing like a payroll / Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul / You can mark my words that I said it first / In a morning warning, no one heard.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Besides resurrecting the feud with Kardashian, both songs set the scene for the highly anticipated release of Reputation (Taylor’s Version), the rerecorded version of the 2017 album. And “Cassandra” in particular mentions snakes, which are prominently associated with Reputation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Scroll ahead to listen to
