Nashville's <a href=#>Tennessean</a> newspaper reports that Emery died in Nashville on Saturday morning (Jan. 15). He was 88 years old.</p><p>According to a statement from his family, the broadcasting legend "passed away peacefully" at Tristar Centennial Medical Center in Nashville, surrounded by his loved ones.</p><p>"Ralph had a deep love for his family, his friends and his fans," the statement reads.</p><p>Born Walter Ralph Emery in the rural Nashville suburb of McEwen, Tenn, in 1933, Emery displayed an early affinity for radio. That led to him launching his career in radio with a stint at WTPR in Paris, Tenn. Emery made the career jump to Nashville's WSM in 1957.</p><p>He interviewed a Who's Who of country's biggest stars river the decades, and his relaxed, conversational style of speaking to artists helped differentiate him from other broadcasters and earned him the respect and trust of his interview subjects. Emery earned the unofficial title of the "Dean of Country Music Broadcasters" over the years, according to the Tennessean.</p><p>The radio icon made the leap to television by hosting The Ralph Emery Show on Nashville's WSMV beginning in 1972, giving viewers early introductions to rising stars including the <a href=#>Judds</a>, who appeared on the show before they had a recording contract. He later hosted the national TV program Nashville Now, a Tonight Show-style country music talk show that enjoyed a long run on TNN from 1983 until 1993.</p><p>The Country Music Hall of Fame inducted Emery in 2007.</p><p>"Ralph Emery's impact in expanding country music's audience is incalculable," Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum CEO Kyle Young says in a statement (quote via <a href=#>WSMV</a>). "On radio and on television, he allowed fans to get to know the people behind the songs. Ralph was more a grand conversationalist than a calculated interviewer, and it was his conversations that revealed the humor and humanity of Tom T. Hall, Barbara Mandrell, Tex Ritter, Marty Robbins and many more. Above all, he believed in music and in the people who make it."</p><p>Emery's cause of death has not yet been revealed. The iconic broadcaster is survived by his wife, Joy Emery, as well as three sons, five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. Funeral arrangements are to be announced.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Remembering the Country Stars Who've Died in 2021:</h2><p>May they rest in peace ...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq5mcpbVuscyeqbJllJqupXnDopysZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jets-stadium-on-west-side-is-now-history.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jets Stadium On West Side Is Now History</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./come-back-visit-her-parrot-tears-flow-online-woman-china-22-weds-dying-love-life-spend-final-days.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Come back to visit her as a parrot: tears flow online as woman in China, 22, weds dying love o</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./book-review-tommy-koh-reader-tommy-koh.html>Book review: The Tommy Koh Reader, by Tommy Koh</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./esther-yu-shuxins-fun-and-daring-style-breadth-chinese-actress-wardrobe-something-behold-donning.html>Esther Yu Shuxins fun and daring style: the breadth of the Chinese actress wardrobe is somethi</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-union-shares-kiss-costar-keith-powers-filming-perfect-find-html.html>Gabrielle Union shares a kiss with her costar Keith Powers while filming The Perfect Find</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./megan-rapinoe-wedding-girlfriend-wife-html.html>Megan Rapinoes Love-Life With Fiance Sue Bird A Look At Her Dating History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mikaela-testa-nude-revenge-selfie-goes-viral-split-atis-paul-html.html>Mikaela Testa: Nude revenge selfie goes viral after split from Atis Paul</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
