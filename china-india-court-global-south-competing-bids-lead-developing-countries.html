data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While China and India have adopted different approaches – with the former focusing on investments and infrastructure – analysts said that both countries regard the Global South as increasingly important to their ambitions to expand influence and shape the changing international order.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ali Wyne, senior analyst with Eurasia Group’s Global Macro-Geopolitics practice, said the key focus of India’s pitch to developing countries has been that it would strive to make prominent global institutions more inclusive and responsive to their voices.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition to the virtual summits, New Delhi has used its presidency of the G20 to work on ensuring that “the concerns of the Global South receive due cognisance”, according to the Indian external affairs ministry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an added boost to India’s efforts, the 55-member African Union (AU) was formally admitted to membership of the G20 at the New Delhi summit in September.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=#

datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While both India and China supported the AU’s bid, it was Modi who welcomed its chairman Azali Assoumani into the G20 fold with a wide grin and a warm embrace. Chinese President Xi Jinping did not attend the event.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The African Union’s admission would “strengthen the G20 and also strengthen the voice of the Global South”, Modi said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Wyne, India was also able to make sure that the Russian war in Ukraine did not distract the G20 from focusing on developing countries’ priorities, including enhancing pandemic preparedness and reducing the global debt burden.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Byron Chong, a research associate at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, said India announced a number of initiatives at the G20 that had allowed it to “position itself as a serious contender to China for leadership of the Global South”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/09/11/clean-thumb_1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among the initiatives – which champion the interests of developing countries – is a plan to reform multilateral development banks and expand their lending capacities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This would help improve access to funding but could also be seen as “an attempt to weaken China’s influence and status as the key source of developmental loans and aid for poorer nations”, Chong wrote, in a September article for the school’s Centre on Asia and Globalisation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">India also announced a massive rail and shipping project connecting India with Europe through the Middle East in partnership with the US, EU and some Gulf and European states – “the most overt indication of India’s intention to compete with China”, according to Chong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Developing countries, particularly in regions such as Africa and Central Asia, have been the key beneficiaries of China’s landmark Belt and Road Initiative since its launch a decade ago.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘G20 coming out party’: India can be bridge in polarised world, say analysts</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the third belt and road forum in October, Xi renewed his commitment to the development of emerging economies and stressed that China’s modernisation was “for all developing countries”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore’s Institute of South Asian Studies, said that China “has been able to mobilise some strategic influence through its infrastructure-building efforts”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“India has instead focused on bringing the concerns of the Global South to the world’s largest and most influential policy forums. It has tried to ensure that specific challenges of the Global South, such as in addressing climate change, get to be heard and responded to.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Palit said the importance of the Global South’s support has grown for both China and India, as countries look to form coalitions with like-minded nations. “China and India are keen on reshaping the international order. In this regard, the Global South is very important for them.”</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Global South had also become more significant because of the shifts in the international order that followed the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw the delivery of “global public goods” becoming an “important source of obtaining strategic influence”, Palit said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the height of the pandemic in December 2021, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported that China had provided more than 1.8 billion vaccine doses to more than 120 countries and international organisations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Indian media said India supplied some 235 million doses to countries including Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China’s focus on developing countries was also on display in August, when Xi attended the Brics summit in Johannesburg, in just his second overseas trip this year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bloc of emerging economies – which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – was an important platform that would “elevate the solidarity and cooperation of developing countries to a higher level”, Xi said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Brics leaders agreed at the summit to invite Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to join the bloc, a move that reflected China’s growing influence, according to observers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alessandro Arduino, affiliate lecturer at King’s College London’s Lau China Institute, said the expansion aligns with China’s extensive involvement with the Global South as the international governance landscape undergoes a “seismic shift”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Beijing’s quest to seize the helm of Global South leadership is a crucial component of its strategy to shape a world characterised by multiple power centres, aiming to exert a more potent influence in global affairs,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In pursuit of global prominence, China positions itself as the champion of developing nations, attempting to redefine major power dynamics by prioritising development.”</p><img

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eurasia Group’s Wyne said China believes that building greater influence in the developing world will be essential to offset growing pressures by advanced industrial democracies – especially the United States – to contest its influence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">India, meanwhile, is of the view that its moves will help it to transform from an Indo-Pacific power into a global one, Wyne said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Competition between China and India to court the Global South will heighten amid the growing distrust between the two powers, whose worsening relations in recent years have been punctuated by clashes along their shared border in the Himalayas, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Wyne, India is likely to consider more ways to include representatives from developing countries at prominent gatherings, such as inviting officials from Southeast Asian nations to attend Quad meetings as guests.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“China will continue to leverage its geoeconomic statecraft to make inroads, but with an emphasis on greener, more sustainable investments,” he added.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=#

China’s belt and road plan makes financing pivot</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Palit said that he expects both countries to further engage with developing countries, with the rivalry spreading across infrastructure development, people-to-people connectivity, and environmental cooperation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, announced at the G20, is likely to be joined by more infrastructure projects led by India, according to Palit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China is already expanding its support for African countries, and in a concrete way, paying for parliamentary buildings, sports stadiums and conference centres across the continent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beijing has also delivered gifts of a US$200 million headquarters for the African Union and an US$80 million base for the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, both in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While analysts agreed that the competition between China and India is set to intensify, they suggested that it may not be possible for one leader to represent all the countries of the Global South, given their vast differences and varied needs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Zack Cooper, senior fellow at Washington-based think tank American Enterprise Institute, while the Brics members share general concerns, there appears to be a lack of agreement on a broad set of rules governing trade, technology and other interactions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The core problem is that there are fundamental differences among the Brics-Plus members, which will limit its ability to actually deliver results,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Countries don’t appear to have a consolidated view … They can’t articulate a shared vision for the future.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0"

analysts</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Palit said that China and India’s bids to position themselves as champions of the Global South have met with a mixed response, largely because developing countries are not homogenous and their interests are not always identical.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other large middle and regional powers such as Russia, Brazil and South Africa might also aspire to lead countries belonging to the Global South, he suggested.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But because of the differences among developing countries and the evolving global situation, it was difficult to visualise one leader that could helm the Global South, Palit said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Wyne, “it would be presumptuous for any one country to conclude that it is ‘the’ representative of the developing world”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“And it is doubtful that developing countries would want to rely wholly on India, China, or any other given country as they look to stabilise their economies amid systemic instability in the international order.”</p><p class=postsid
