But even as the 77-year-old juggles designing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her new women’s apparel line for HSN</a>, her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">home decor</a> line, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her own line of wigs</a> in partnership with Paula Young, and a self-entitled <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a beauty line</a>, the former <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie’s Angel</a> is keeping her focus firmly on family.</p><p>“I think as you get older, the balance of things is more important. I don’t want to miss the moments,” Smith told First for Women in 2017. “If anything recharges me or keeps me sane or keeps me grounded, it has to be my family. I don’t know how you make it if you don’t have your loved ones. To have a sense of the value of time and loved ones is the best part of life.”</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>“One of the joys right now is watching my daughter be a mother, and she is such a good one,” the actress said. “My granddaughter Bea smiles all the time. It’s like a gift from the heavens.” And to keep up that joyful outlook as she navigates the hectic schedule of creating her new fashion line brings, Jaclyn relies on a few smart, easy strategies she’s learned over the years:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jaclyn Smith beauty secret: deep conditioner</h2><p>“If you dye your hair, I believe you should deep-condition it every four to six weeks,” Smith told us. “I use a cholesterol conditioning cream. Or you can go into your kitchen and throw on something moisturizing like olive or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">coconut oil</a>. Then once it’s on, either put a heat cap on or wrap your hair in plastic wrap and just cover it with a hot towel for 10 to 20 minutes. It just gives your hair a break.” (Click through for more on how to do a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">coconut oil hair mask</a> and to learn more about why her signature <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">butterfly haircut</a> is back in style.)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jaclyn Smith style secret: less is more</h2><p>“My mother was very fashionable well into her 90s and had a natural sense of how to mix things up and make them her own. She always looked like a million dollars,” Smith says of her style inspiration. “But if I’m ever in doubt, I always say less is more and turn to the classics. I have certain things that when I’m rushing around, I know I can reach for and they’re always comfortable — and always look great. A great pair of black pants or jeans, a white silk or cotton shirt and a blazer always works wherever you go. These are just classic things that I call ‘no-brainers.’ You just put them on and they work.” (Click through for genius ways to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">style around wide-legged pants</a>.)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jaclyn Smith fitness secret: planks</h2><p>“At this point in my life, I’m not going to be a slave to working out. If I’m asked if I want to work out or hold my granddaughter, she comes first,” Smith said. “But when I play with her or hold her in my arms, I’m instantly more aware of the muscles I need to work on and build. That little girl gives me the motivation to do it. So now I do circuit training. It’s a mix of weights, stretches, and core work — a lot of planks! They keep my core and lower back strong. I may add an arm or leg lift with the plank so it’s not just stagnant.” (Click through for more details on how do to do a plank and other <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ab workouts for women</a>.)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jaclyn Smith nutrition secret: once-a-week cheat</h2><p>“I grew up on a farm eating fresh foods with no hormones or preservatives and still try to eat that way,” Smith said. “I enjoy a lot of raw vegetables, organic meats, all forms of lettuce. I love okra, whether it’s fried, steamed or pickled. But I also believe in everything in moderation — you can’t be too disciplined. Being too regimented sort of steals the joy sometimes.” Here are some of Smith’s guilt-free pleasures: “Once a week I’ll enjoy <a href=#>a little fried Southern food</a>, some Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, or a nice lean hamburger with lettuce, tomato, pickle, and a little mayonnaise and mustard — because that’s how we like them in Texas.” (You won’t want to miss this delicious <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘grandma pizza’ recipe</a>.)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jaclyn Smith beauty secret: the right moisturizer</h2><p>After decades of trying out beauty products on set, Smith has seen what works and what doesn’t — and she put that knowledge to work when developing her skin-care line. “You want to find a moisturizer that doesn’t separate makeup,” she said. “That way, you can take a sponge and dab a little moisturizer on over your makeup and it refreshes it. It gets into the lines and brings out more color and vibrancy to your skin so it doesn’t look dry. I often reapply this way midday if I have to go somewhere.” To keep wrinkles at bay, Smith relies on a potent antioxidant. “I’m a big believer in retinol at night. It’s the gold standard for anti-aging. It takes away brown spots, it diminishes pore size, it builds collagen, and it sloughs off old skin.” Indeed, a study in <a title=_blank href=#>JAMA Dermatology</a> found that using retinol three times a week reduced the appearance of subjects’ fine lines and wrinkles by 31 percent over six months. Sounds like the closest we’ll get to the fountain of youth in a jar!
